Their results were published in the journal  Device  this week. \n Today, solar panels power satellites, space stations, and Mars and lunar rovers. All these arrays are currently built on Earth and launched into space. But as humanity pushes for a permanent lunar presence, the need for solar power is set to skyrocket ‚Äî and so will the cost of getting panels there. \n Felix Lang, lead author of the paper, said that while the silicon-based solar cells used in space now are ‚Äúamazing‚Äù ‚Äî reaching efficiencies of 30% to 40% ‚Äî they are very expensive. They are also heavy because they use glass or a thick foil as a cover. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to justify lifting all these cells into space,‚Äù he said.

By creating moonglass directly on the lunar surface and pairing it with a thin layer of perovskite crystals brought from Earth, the researchers found they could slash launch mass by 99%. \n Building solar panels on the Moon \n An artist‚Äôs impression of future solar cell fabrication on the Moon. Credit: Sercan √ñzen \n Once the materials are collected, turning them into solar panels on the Moon would require ‚Äúminimal equipment,‚Äù according to the researchers, because they can be made with raw regolith that doesn‚Äôt need to be pre-processed. The team says¬†they have already achieved promising results by using a large curved mirror and sunlight to focus a beam hot enough to melt regolith into moonglass. \n Since moonglass is made from raw regolith, it‚Äôs milky-white instead of transparent, limiting its light-harvesting potential. The best prototypes from the Potsdam team reached about 12% efficiency ‚Äî roughly half that of conventional perovskite cells. But simulations suggest they could eventually match the efficiency of conventional perovskite cells.¬† \n Nicholas Bennett at the University of Technology Sydney told  New Scientist  that this is the first successful use of moonglass in a functioning solar cell. The real challenge now, he says, is producing large quantities of the stuff outside of the lab. \n Moonglass panels are the latest in a string of high-tech bids to lay the foundations for a permanent human presence on the Moon. Other planned projects include using moon dust to  3D-print a lunar base , building  oxygen extraction systems  from regolith, and even building  space mirrors  that melt the Moon‚Äôs ice into drinking water. \n Space age technologies will be appearing on Earth during¬† TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Isar Aerospace said the aim of the launch was ‚Äúto collect as much data and experience as possible.‚Äù \n The 28-meter¬†(91-foot) Spectrum is a two-stage launch vehicle designed to propel small and medium-sized satellites into orbit. \n The company expects to produce as many as 40 rockets per year from its new factory, which is currently under construction outside its headquarters in Munich. Spectrum launch vehicles 2 and 3 are already in production, Isar said. \n Spectru m‚Äôs in augural flight marks the first-ever ver tical orbital  rocket launch i n cont inental E urope  outside Russia.   \n V ir gin Orbit a ttempt ed an  orbital la un ch from the UK  in 2 0 2 3, but ¬†the plan failed.

The com pany l ooks to la unch up  to 15 missions per year from  And √∏ya, at a cost of aro und ‚Ç¨1 0mn per flight. \n Opening up orbital launches from Western Europe promises to simplify logistics for European satellite operators by eliminating the need to ship payloads overseas. Access to smaller, cheaper launch vehicles that can place a single satellite in orbit could also offer a more flexible, fast, and precise alternative to ride-sharing. \n Then there are the geopolitical considerations. Launching from continental Europe would reduce reliance on foreign launch providers like SpaceX, enhancing sovereign access to space amid growing geopolitical tensions. \n Metzler touched on  that point in a statement last week: ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs geopolitical climate, our first test flight is about much more than a rocket launch.‚Äù \n Founded  in 2018  as a spin-off   f rom Techni cal University Munich, Isar Aerospace has secured ‚Ç¨400mn to date, making it Europ e‚Äôs mo st  well- f unded  private  space company. \n While And√∏ya is Europe‚Äôs first continental spaceport, others are underway, the most advanced being the  SaxaVord spaceport  in the Shetlan d Island s off Scotland. \n Rocket Factory Augsburg, a rival to Isar,  was m eant to launch from the site last year.  Howeve r, the startup suffered a major setback after its  rocket exploded   during   a st atic-fire test , pushing back  its in augu ral f light to later this year.¬†¬† \n                         \n\n                         \n                             \n                                 \n\n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                        Story by\n                                     \n\n                                     \n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n Geschwindt\n                                         \n                                     \n                                 \n\n                                \n                                                                     \n                                         \n\n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

It identifies 65  startups  in this space, 54 of which are European, which have collectively raised $900mn. Over half of these companies were founded within the past five years, with 12 emerging in just the last 12 months.¬† \n A greener vision of AI \n The report highlights three key technologies that hold the most potential to decarbonise AI.¬† \n The first is advanced semiconductor materials such as Gallium Nitride (GaN), Silicon Carbide (SiC), and graphene. These could significantly reduce AI‚Äôs energy consumption by improving efficiency and thermal performance in computing hardware.¬† \n One of the leading innovators in this space is Welsh startup  Space Forge . The company is leveraging the microgravity, vacuum, and extreme temperatures of space to produce semiconductors that it claims are three to five times purer than those made on Earth.¬† \n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve pushed the efficiency of silicon chips to their limit,‚Äù said Joshua Western, CEO and cofounder at  Space Forge . \n Another promising avenue lies in new computing paradigms, such as quantum, neuromorphic, and optical computing.  Quantum computers , for instance, promise to solve complex calculations much faster than classical machines, potentially reducing computational time and overall energy consumption.¬† \n ‚ÄúClassical computers are getting too big, too expensive, and use too much energy and water,‚Äù said  In√©s De Vega ,  VP of innovation at  IQM , Europe‚Äôs best-funded quantum computing startup.  ‚ÄúQuantum computing can both find new solutions to  climate change  but also drastically reduce the overall energy consumption of computing itself.‚Äù \n Another type of computing gaining traction is optical computing, which leverages photons ‚Äî particles of light ‚Äî instead of electrons. It could dramatically increase processing speed, as demonstrated by Germany‚Äôs Black Semiconductor. The company‚Äôs photonics processors could transmit signals 100 to 1,000 times faster than traditional electronic chips. \n Anastasiia Nosova, a former chip engineer at German semiconductor giant  Infineon  and host of the  Anastasi In Tech podcast, argued that  photonic chips could be 100 times more energy efficient than regular silicon semiconductors. ‚ÄúThey are one of the most important developments in computing right now,‚Äù she said at the Munich event..¬†¬† \n While hardware fixes will be critical, there‚Äôs also work to be done in advanced software that makes AI‚Äôs energy use more efficient. One of the startups working on this is London-based Deep Render. The company uses  deep learning  to compress files while retaining quality beyond what was previously possible. This reduces the volume of data that needs to be transmitted or stored, and thus the amount of computing power required.¬† \n While these technologies hold potential, they‚Äôre still in the nascent stages of development. Meanwhile, the energy needed to train AI models is doubling every three to four months,  according to OpenAI .¬†¬† \n ‚ÄúFor these computing solutions to scale in Europe, we need a lot of venture capital but also government backing,‚Äù said Saharova. She believes that Europe needs to allocate about  ‚Ç¨1 trillion to bring climate tech, including green computing, to the ‚Äúlevel it needs to be.‚Äù¬† \n The future of AI will be a hot topic at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

The vehicle was set to launch in 2022, but when Russia invaded Ukraine, ESA severed ties with Moscow, putting the mission in jeopardy. Rosalind Franklin ‚Äî named after  the British chemist whose work was crucial to understanding the structure of DNA‚Äî  was left without several key components, including a landing platform to safely touch down on the Martian surface.¬† \n But now, ESA and  Thales Alenia Space, the prime contractor for the ExoMars mission,  have issued Airbus a  ¬£150mn contract to build a new lander at the company‚Äôs facility in Stevenage, UK. The British government will fund the lander via the UK Space Agency.¬†¬† \n ‚ÄúGetting the Rosalind Franklin rover onto the surface of Mars is a huge international challenge and the culmination of more than 20 years‚Äô work,‚Äù said Kata Escott, managing director at Airbus Defence and Space UK, which also designed and built the rover.¬†¬†¬†¬† \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     The ExoMars spacecraft is set to launch from the US in 2028.

Credit: DSIT \n As the spacecraft approaches Mars, the lander ‚Äî carrying the rover ‚Äî will separate and begin its rapid descent into the atmosphere. A combination of a heat shield, parachutes, and braking rockets will slow down the lander  just before touchdown.¬† \n Once on the surface, the lander will deploy ramps, allowing the rover to drive off and begin its exploration.  Rosalind Franklin‚Äôs instruments will look for evidence of past and present Martian life. The rover includes a drill designed to probe as deep as two metres into the surface, acquiring samples shielded from radiation on the surface. It‚Äôs designed to operate for at least seven months.¬† \n Since its fallout with Russia, ESA has secured new agreements for various components of the ExoMars spacecraft, including a contract with NASA to supply adjustable braking engines for the landing platform and radioisotope heating units (RHUs). These RHUs use radioactive decay to generate heat, preventing the rover from freezing in the frigid Martian environment. \n                         \n\n                         \n                             \n                                 \n\n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                        Story by\n                                     \n\n                                     \n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n Geschwindt\n                                         \n                                     \n                                 \n\n                                \n                                                                     \n                                         \n\n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

As the founder and CEO of Ukrainian scaleup MacPaw, Kosovan runs his business in a country under invasion. The company has even been hit by missile barrages. \n As relentless Russian bombing and shelling pummel Ukraine, his team presses on with their work. In October, they released a new version of CleanMyMac, MacPaw‚Äôs flagship maintenance and optimisation product.¬† \n ‚ÄúIt was completely developed during the war,‚Äù Kosovan tells TNW on a video call from his home in Kyiv. \n The software earned  rave   reviews . But two months later, the horrors of war arrived at MacPaw‚Äôs doorstep. \n The üíú of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! On a cold December morning, another devastating Russian ballistic missile attack struck Kyiv. The explosion hit MacPaw‚Äôs headquarters, shattering the building‚Äôs facade, windows, and engineering equipment. According to the rescue services, one person was killed in the attack.¬† \n Kosovan was en route to an event when a message about the strike appeared on his phone. \n ‚ÄúThe only thing we could do is initiate our emergency procedures,‚Äù Kosovan says. ‚ÄúWe had plans for this risk and they helped us to organise actions ‚Äî because people were panicked. They didn‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù \n Safety measures were swiftly implemented, emergency checks conducted, and recovery steps taken. The next day, MacPaw gained access to the office building. Staff worked alongside emergency services to salvage equipment and prevent further damage.¬† \n The company‚Äôs office spans three floors of the building. The hardest hit of them is still not operational, but the others have reopened. Staff are already working in them again. \n MacPaw‚Äôs wartime adaptations had given the business a head start on the recovery. Many team members were already working remotely. Processes had become highly automated. Staff were spread out geographically and shifts were scheduled to cover all critical roles during emergencies and military call-ups. \n While the missile strike was traumatic, MacPaw had been prepared. \n Preparing for war \n Numerous buildings were damaged by the missile strike. Credit: MacPaw \n As Russian troops amassed on the border with Ukraine in late 2021, MacPaw began disaster planning.¬† \n The company devised mitigation measures for various threats, from cyber attacks to Russian forces taking control of the office. An emergency team was formed from each product and service unit, with members based either outside Ukraine or in the country‚Äôs safer western regions. \n Communications security was beefed up, with Signal adopted as a new messaging service. Office infrastructure was moved entirely to the cloud. Satellite internet was set up to cover the risk of internet loss. The company then waited for reports on Russia‚Äôs military moves. \n On day one of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, MacPaw activated its risk mitigation plan. \n ‚ÄúWe had to refocus our priorities,‚Äù Kosovan says. ‚ÄúThe first of them was, of course, the safety of our people, and then the continuity of our business.‚Äù \n A code freeze regime was implemented for all products and infrastructure, with no changes permitted without prior approval from the emergency team. \n Hardware management strategies also shifted. With supply chains disrupted, new laptops now had to be sourced from abroad. At times, system administrators had to drive to remote locations and personally deliver laptops to team members. \n As wartime conditions became routine, the team adapted to their new reality. Nowadays, their biggest challenge is Russia‚Äôs relentless attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. \n The strikes cause frequent and protracted power outages. In MacPaw‚Äôs home town of Kyiv, daily blackouts of eight hours have become commonplace, leading more team members to work from the office. To keep operations running, the company has installed extra power and internet access lines. A backup generator has also been acquired, alongside an uninterrupted internet access point via Starlink. \n ‚ÄúStarlink helps a lot,‚Äù Kosovan says. ‚ÄúIt is one of the saving factors for Ukraine.‚Äù \n The new measures have kept MacPaw‚Äôs systems running throughout Russia‚Äôs attacks on Ukraine‚Äôs power grid. But the human impacts have been harder to resolve. \n \n The recovery process \n Windows have been covered in wooden panels to protect what remained inside MacPaw‚Äôs office. Credit: MacPaw \n Although no MacPaw staff were physically harmed in the missile attack, the psychological toll has been profound. \n ‚ÄúThe greatest challenge we and many other companies are facing here right now is not the destruction of the offices, but the exhaustion of these people,‚Äù says Kosovan. ‚ÄúMentally, this is very hard to process. People are breaking sometimes, and it is very hard to predict and help them.‚Äù \n For months, staff in Kyiv have endured air strikes day and night. ‚ÄúPeople cannot sleep normally because they always hear these explosions in the air‚Ä¶They don‚Äôt know whether the next night a drone will hit their house or not.‚Äù \n The brutality of the December missile attack was a stark contrast to the previous day at MacPaw. Staff had been preparing holiday gifts for  Children of Heroes , an organisation that supports Ukrainian children who have lost parents in the war. \n Through the  MacPaw Foundation , the company also provides Ukrainians with non-lethal aid, including protective gear, IT equipment, and medical supplies. Since 2022, the non-profit has distributed over $12mn in total support \n Alongside the humanitarian projects, Kosovan is helping to sustain the country‚Äôs IT sector. He‚Äôs personally invested in almost 20 Ukrainian businesses, including Osavul, a Kyiv-based AI  startup  that analyses information threats. \n Formed to counter Russian propaganda, Osavul now offers services to governments and businesses alike. ‚ÄúOur goal is to review the narratives, show which of them are dangerous, and then give you all the intelligence to understand what you can do,‚Äù Dmytro Bilash, the startup‚Äôs co-founder,  told TNW  last year. \n In combat zones, Ukrainian tech also has a powerful impact. Innovations range from a growing fleet of domestic drones to Delta, a battlefield management system. Developed by the military, the  software  combines a variety of tools, from digital maps to secure communications.¬† \n Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Yelyzaveta Boiko describes the system as ‚ÄúGoogle for the military.‚Äù ‚ÄúGoogle helps to organise your workspace, DELTA helps to organise your war space,‚Äù she  said  last year. \n Beyond the theatre of war, MacPaw has sought to preserve Ukraine‚Äôs tech heritage. The latest result is  Innovation in Isolation  ‚Äî¬†a book that chronicles the country‚Äôs IT history. \n The past and future of Ukrainian tech \n Oleksandr Kosovan remains optimistic about the future of Ukrainian IT. Credit: MacPaw \n Released in Europe and the US last month,  Innovation in Isolation  explores Ukrainian tech from the 1940s to today. \n Through archival research, interviews with IT luminaries, and vivid photography, the book unravels the country‚Äôs digital evolution. The stories span from cybernetics pioneers to modern innovators such as Grammarly and  Reface .¬† \n All proceeds from the book will go to humanitarian relief efforts through the MacPaw Foundation. Yet the project is not solely a charitable endeavour.¬† \n ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also important to talk about the history, because we all see how Russia tries to change the past by rewriting the history and claiming a lot of things as their own,‚Äù says Kosovan. \n ‚ÄúMany things that were considered to be built in Russia or USSR were actually created by Ukrainians and Ukraine. This partially explains why there are so many great tech companies from Ukraine. We have a very rich heritage.‚Äù¬† \n Even after missile strikes, that heritage continues to flourish. \n ‚ÄúThere are many companies that emerge in these hard times,‚Äù Kosovan says. ‚ÄúHard times produce strong people.

Today‚Äôs top tech talent wants something far more valuable: their health. That‚Äôs the view of Lucien Engelen, a renowned healthcare innovation expert, who believes workplace wellbeing is about to spark a seismic shift. This transition will not only transform employment perks, but also create a new tech market. \n Engelen‚Äôs vision draws on deep experience.¬†Across three decades in healthcare, his work has spanned acute care, ambulance services, and dispatch centres. As the founding director of the REshape Center of the Radboud University Medical Center, he spent eight years developing and implementing healthcare technologies, grabbing headlines for efforts to  integrate patients  in their own care and improve service provision  with social media . \n Today, he focuses on running Transform.Health, which assists organisations such as Vodafone, Erasmus University Medical Center, Deloitte, and Sanofi in their healthcare strategies. He also delivers 100 keynotes a year across the globe about the subject.  \n These roles revealed a fundamental flaw in conventional treatment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve built a sick care system, not a healthcare system,‚Äù he says. \n Engelen compares the problem to bad plumbing.   ‚ÄúWe wait until water gushes out of the wall before fixing the leak, instead of turning off the tap.‚Äù  Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sj√∂holm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper \n                         Take me there \n                     \n For Engelen, the fix is obvious. We need to shift the focus from treating illnesses to preventing them. And employers have a crucial role to play. \n At  TNW Conference  on June 19, Engelen will share his vision in full during a talk titled ‚ÄúCODE RED: Why the Future of Work is the Future of Health.‚Äù Ahead of the event, he shared a glimpse of what to expect. \n Employers as catalysts for wellbeing \n The business case for staff wellbeing is obvious: healthier employees deliver higher performance. Illness, stress, and long waits for medical care drain their productivity and availability. \n ‚ÄúIf it takes eight weeks to get a consultation, that‚Äôs eight weeks of lower productivity,‚Äù Engelen notes. ‚ÄúAnd if they leave due to poor health, replacing them can cost about ‚Ç¨40,000 in rehiring and training someone to reach the same level.‚Äù \n To stay ahead, forward-thinking employers are getting proactive. Instead of waiting for health problems to arise, they‚Äôre offering services that can prevent them.¬† \n Technology is rapidly expanding the possibilities. From digital wellbeing  apps  and fitness trackers to online therapy, these perks are becoming a competitive advantage in attracting elite workers.¬† \n As Engelen says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all fishing in the same bucket of talent.‚Äù \n To attract that talent, he urges  employers to apply a broader concept of wellbeing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only about your physical health. There‚Äôs¬†also your mental health, and even your social health and financial health.‚Äù \n   Gradually, this holistic model is shaping modern  workplaces. \n The next generation \n For employers, mental health services have become a growing focus ‚Äî and with good reason. Deloitte research found that UK organisations investing in mental health support see an average return of  five to one . \n The benefits could be especially impactful for younger workers. A  recent study  by PwC found that almost four in 10 Gen Z employees in the UK have seriously considered leaving their jobs in the last year, with mental health ‚Äúa major driver.‚Äù¬† \n Digital services offer promising solutions. Yet they also introduce new challenges. \n ‚ÄúThe same Gen Z that is willing to step down due to mental health concerns also thinks privacy is very important ‚Äî for the right reasons,‚Äù Engelen says. ‚ÄúThe challenge now for companies is offering solutions without sacrificing their privacy.‚Äù \n Engelen sees employers addressing this by offering third-party services that staff can use confidentially, away from the prying eyes of bosses or colleagues. For instance, they‚Äôre providing anonymised access to online mental health services and fitness apps connected to gyms outside the company ‚Äî with no  data  flowing back to the business. \n This growing focus on employee wellbeing also has powerful potential for  tech  firms. Engelen envisions a new market emerging for them. \n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see an increase in Big Tech closing big contracts with big corporates,‚Äù he says.¬† \n ‚ÄúWe will also see Big Tech acquiring more startups in this sector than ever before, because they can not only get this technology scaled, but also access a market that is willing to pay for it. Now that employers see the real financial benefit of this, it is going to create a new revenue stream.‚Äù \n For tech companies, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same is true for employers.¬† \n The future of wellbeing in the workplace \n The benefits of healthy workplaces are well-established. Researchers have found that the ROI on employee wellness programs  can be  six to one.¬† \n ‚ÄúEmployers are realising that investing in prevention is far cheaper than paying for treatment or replacing talent ‚Äî and can also attract talent,‚Äù Engelen explains. \n Accessibility to digital wellbeing is also set to increase. Integration layers are connecting more and more healthcare apps, creating new approaches to medical care. The EU, meanwhile, recently ratified the European Health Data Space regulation, which will enforce mandatory access to medical records on users‚Äô smartphones. \n As the technology progresses and enters the workplace, the ripple effects could improve lives and productivity, while alleviating pressure on overburdened health systems. \n By embracing wellbeing tech, Engelen believes employers can accelerate a shift from reactive healthcare to proactive prevention. \n ‚ÄúThe technology is already there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs changing is how we‚Äôre using it. Employers have realised that investing in health and wellbeing is not just good for their people ‚Äî it‚Äôs good for business.‚Äù ¬† \n Lucien Engelen will be among the  standout speakers  at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Citing seven current and former DeepMind scientists, the newspaper said the company has introduced stricter vetting and additional bureaucracy, making it harder to publish research . The changes aim to protect the company‚Äôs edge in AI, the sources said. \n Acquired by Google  in 2014 , DeepMind has long been a leader in computer science breakthroughs. In recent years, however, the lab has faced increasing competition from the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek.  Under growing pressure to stay ahead, the company is reportedly erecting new barriers around its innovations and reputation. \n The new constraints have alarmed  Anita Schj√∏ll Abildgaard , co-founder and CEO of  Iris.ai , a Norwegian startup developing an AI-powered  engine for science .

The company‚Äôs pioneering  innovations  and enormous citation counts have overshadowed other researchers in the field, who could now receive a larger share of the spotlight. But Abildgaard warns the drawbacks will far outweigh the benefits. \n ‚ÄúResearchers across industries will have less access to DeepMind‚Äôs undoubtedly impressive work,‚Äù she said. \n She pointed to the example of DeepMind‚Äôs  AlphaFold , a system that predicts protein structure with remarkable accuracy. The software has been  hailed  as a solution to one of biology‚Äôs biggest mysteries, with potential to fuel countless advances, from discovering new drugs to tackling climate change. \n ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine projects of this importance being released so readily under this new diktat,‚Äù Abildgaard said. \n The impacts, she warned, could be severe.

In October, the software firm rode overtook ASML to become Europe‚Äôs most valuable  tech  company.¬† \n ASML, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, makes chip-making equipment for most of the world‚Äôs largest semiconductor companies. As the only firm that manufactures the EUV lithography machines required to produce the world‚Äôs most advanced computer chips, the Dutch business has become an investor darling.¬† \n However, ASML‚Äôs shares  plummeted dramatically  in in October, wiping ‚Ç¨50bn off its market cap in one fell swoop.¬† \n The plunge came after the Dutch firm said it did not receive the expected number of orders for its lithography machines and expects fewer net sales for 2025 than previously estimated.¬† \n That news also sparked a  global sell-off  on chip stocks, as investors worried that demand may be faltering. However,  analysts  were quick to point out that weak orders at ASML were more a sign that chipmakers had been stockpiling chips than a longer-term problem.¬† \n Since then, ASML‚Äôs stock has soared, plunged, and risen again. In January,  shares jumped  as much as 12% ‚Äî the largest increase in nearly five years ‚Äî  following a surge in order bookings. The company currently ranks as Europe‚Äôs fourth most valuable, with Paris-based LVMH in third place behind SAP and Novo.¬† \n The shifting fortunes of Europe‚Äôs biggest companies reflect the volatility of today‚Äôs global markets.

A week before that, Donald Trump promoted Tesla on the White House front lawn, after rallying people to buy the company‚Äôs cars and stock.¬† \n The Trump administration‚Äôs endorsements of Musk‚Äôs companies are attracting growing scrutiny. Critics argue that they‚Äôre  breaking laws  and  threatening democracy . For the world‚Äôs richest man, the relationship is also causing business problems. \n One involves Italy‚Äôs plans for Starlink. The country has halted talks for a proposed  ‚Ç¨1.5bn contract  with the service, defence minister  Guido Crosetto  said in an  interview  Saturday.¬†¬† \n ‚ÄúEverything has come to a standstill, partly because the topic has shifted from Starlink to statements by and about the person [Musk],‚Äù said the minister.¬†¬† \n Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sj√∂holm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper \n                         Take me there \n                     It‚Äôs the latest development in a hot debate among Italian politicians over encrypted satellite communication services for officials in high-risk areas. Lawmakers are divided between choosing Starlink or a rival provider, such as French firm  Eutelsat .¬† \n Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni‚Äôs government  has considered using Starlink for a while now. However, opposition parties have warned against relying on Musk‚Äôs firm¬† ‚Äî a concern heightened by reports last month that the US may cut Ukraine off from Starlink if a minerals deal is not reached.¬† \n Musk refuted those claims. Nonetheless,   his control   over Ukraine‚Äôs connectivity has caused growing alarm. It forms  part of a broader discussion in Italy and Europe about reducing reliance on non-European tech for critical infrastructure.¬† \n Politics meets business for Musk \n Question marks over Starlink mark one of a succession of setbacks for Musk, whose  role in the Trump administration and open support of far-right politicians has sparked a global backlash, with Tesla bearing the brunt.¬†¬† \n European sales of Teslas plummeted 58% in the first two months of this year. Analysts have attributed the nosedive in part to Musk‚Äôs association with the White House and his embrace of MAGA politics.¬† \n ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that ‚Äòthe Musk factor‚Äô has influenced Tesla‚Äôs sales in the same way as his reputation impacted Twitter when he bought it and rebranded it as X,‚Äù Andrew Fellows, an automotive industry expert at Star, a global tech consultancy,  previously told TNW . \n Tesla stock has fallen 40% since January. But people aren‚Äôt just voting with their wallets ‚Äî there have also been widespread protests against the EV brand.¬† \n Tesla‚Äôs dealerships have been  vandalised .

The Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO), Britain‚Äôs data privacy watchdog, stresses that despite the insolvency, customers remain protected by the same data privacy laws. \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     ‚ÄúAs a matter of UK law, the protections and restrictions of the UK GDPR continue to apply and 23andMe remains under an obligation to protect the personal information of its customers,‚Äù said Stephen Bonner, the ICO‚Äôs deputy commissioner.¬† \n However, the ICO has previously ruled that 23andMe may have violated its privacy rules.¬† \n The 23andMe track record \n After the 2023 breach, the ICO and the Privacy  Commissioner of Canada  launched a joint investigation into 23andMe. Earlier this month, the ICO issued a notice of intent to fine the company ¬£4.59mn ($5.93mn).  ¬† \n ‚ÄúGenetic information is among the most sensitive personal data that a person can entrust to a company[,] and organisations handling such data are required to uphold a very high standard of security and governance in accordance with [the law],‚Äù Bonner said in response to the bankruptcy filing.¬† \n In the US, meanwhile, the legal protections vary. \n While users in the UK and EU have GDPR protections, data  privacy  laws in the US are less comprehensive and vary considerably from state to state.¬† \n 23andMe claims that the company does not share the personal or medical information of any of its customers without consent. Yet with 23andMe‚Äôs track record, neither the company‚Äôs assurances nor legal protections may quell customers‚Äô fears. During bankruptcy proceedings, the company may also have fewer resources at its disposal to fight off hackers. And under new ownership, things look even more uncertain. \n According to 23andMe‚Äôs own  privacy statement , if the company undergoes bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganisation, or sale of assets,¬† ‚Äúyour Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction.‚Äù¬† \n How to delete your 23andMe data \n Given the sensitivity of the data people have shared with 23andMe, the previous breach, and the company‚Äôs financial problems, customers may decide to just delete their data entirely.  California Attorney General Rob Bonta has  urged  them to do just that.¬† \n ‚ÄúI remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,‚Äù Bonta said. \n Users in Europe, meanwhile, have the ‚Äúright to erasure,‚Äù which allows individuals to request that 23andMe deletes their personal data and destroys any medical samples in the company‚Äôs possession.¬†¬† \n Here‚Äôs how to do it:¬† \n \n L og in to your account and go to ‚ÄúSettings,‚Äù then scroll to ‚Äú23andMe Data‚Äù and click ‚ÄúView.‚Äù  \n From there, select ‚ÄúDelete Data,‚Äù confirm your request, and your data will be permanently removed. You can also download a copy of your genetic data before deleting it. \n To delete your test sample, go to ‚ÄúSettings,‚Äù then ‚ÄúPreferences,‚Äù where you can manage your options.¬† ¬† \n \n Europe‚Äôs tech regulations will come under the microscope at  TNW Conference .

Among their explanations are stiff competition,  overspending , allegations of  mismanagement , and a lack of state support.¬†¬† \n Northvolt may be bankrupt, but the fight for a strong European battery ecosystem is far from over. That‚Äôs the consensus from several tech investors and startups we‚Äôve spoken to in recent weeks. \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     Creating a  sustainable  and competitive battery value chain in  Europe , though, will be littered with challenges. One of them ‚Äî competition from the East ‚Äî may be insurmountable. \n The continent faces two clear options: collaborate with Asia‚Äôs industry giants or build a stronghold in the next frontier of battery tech. \n China looms large \n Northvolt set its sights on capturing 25% of Europe‚Äôs battery market by 2030, hoping to wrestle supply away from Chinese and South Korean companies. Together, these two nations  supplied  Europe with 90% of its batteries last year. \n While Northvolt faltered ‚Äî failing to meet its targets and losing key clients ‚Äî Chinese battery firms forged one deal after another with European automakers. Notable among them were Gotion‚Äôs partnership with Volkswagen and CATL‚Äôs joint venture with Stellantis to build a ‚Ç¨4.1bn lithium battery factory in Spain. \n Asian battery manufacturers have been steadily expanding their reach into European  startups , too. Gotion acquired a 25% stake in Slovakia‚Äôs InoBat in 2023. Founded in 2019, the battery startup has raised $400mn to date, with Gotion a major backer.¬† \n ‚ÄúWhile Gotion and InoBat pursue very different strategies and are fully independent, InoBat has benefited from Gotion‚Äôs long track record, experience and know-how, helping to avoid fatal mistakes,‚Äù InoBat‚Äôs CEO and co-founder  Marian Bocek tells TNW.¬† \n Gotion and InoBat have formed a joint venture to build a ‚Ç¨1.2bn lithium-ion battery plant in Slovakia, slated for completion in 2027. The batteries will be destined for EVs and electric aircraft.¬† \n InoBat is building a smaller gigafactory in Slovakia to produce batteries for high-performance EVs, with testing already underway for European automakers, including Ferrari. \n British solid-state battery firm Ilika is another European hopeful taking advantage of China‚Äôs battery superiority.  Graeme Purdy, t he company‚Äôs CEO, cited a lack of ‚ÄúAsian partnerships‚Äù as one potential reason for Northvolt‚Äôs downfall. ‚Äú Global cooperation offers the strongest path to commercial success,‚Äù he tells TNW.¬†¬† \n Ilika is shipping its first samples to 17 automakers this year, the company said. Instead of building a gigafactory, the UK-based outfit plans to license its technology to other companies. Ilika has a long-standing research partnership with Japanese automotive giant Toyota. \n For European startups, the appeal of partnering with East Asian battery makers is obvious. They have the tech, scale, and supply chain efficiency that Europe lacks.¬† \n However, that reliance comes with risks.  \n Opportunities and threats \n The dependence on Chinese companies has sparked several concerns. Trade ¬†disputes, geopolitical tensions, or sudden export restrictions could send battery supply chains into chaos or even sever existing agreements, leaving European firms scrambling for alternatives.¬† \n Tom Johnstone, interim chair of Northvolt, has called on European politicians to invest heavily in local battery startups instead. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a cost to pay for it, but there can be a bigger cost to pay for not doing it,‚Äù he told the  Financial Times . He hopes Europe  will ‚Äúuse the foundation‚Äù that Northvolt had provided to establish its own competitive battery industry. \n A Northvolt gigafactory in Sweden‚Äôs icy north made Europe‚Äôs first domestically produced lithium-ion battery in 2021. Credit: Northvolt \n Northvolt‚Äôs operations in Sweden are now up for sale. Volkswagen, Scania, and Volvo are all potential buyers, while some  experts believe  a Chinese company will acquire the business.¬†¬† \n Either way,  Danijel Vi≈°eviƒá, partner and co-founder at Europe‚Äôs largest climate tech VC, World Fund, thinks European startups should focus their attention on cornering the market for next-generation battery chemistries, not lithium-ion cells. \n ‚ÄúWhen it comes to  lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries , China has won,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNorthvolt should have realised that earlier ‚Äî they moved to new innovative materials too late.‚Äù¬† \n Recharging Europe‚Äôs battery sector \n Louis Fearn, principal at InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover, argues that Europe ought to shift its strategy. ‚ÄúThe way forward for Europe will be to focus not on challenging China, but on securing domestic supplies of raw materials and exploring frontier technologies.‚Äù \n Europe‚Äôs emerging battery players could do well to bet on the next frontier of battery tech where the playing field is still open. \n Kevin Brundish, CEO of Dutch battery maker LionVolt, agrees. He‚Äôs adamant that Europe‚Äôs expertise in next-generation battery tech is keeping ‚Äúthe dream of battery sovereignty within grasp‚Äù.¬† \n ‚ÄúOur robust ecosystem of startups and scale-ups is already pioneering breakthrough technologies in silicon and lithium-metal anodes ‚Äî innovations essential for next-generation high-performance batteries,‚Äù Brundish tells TNW. \n LionVolt spun out from TNO‚Äôs Holst Centre in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in¬†2020. The startup is working on a 3D  lithium-metal anode  that improves energy transfer in lithium-ion, sodium-ion and, in the future, solid-state batteries.¬†¬† \n LionVolt is one of an emerging cohort of startups looking to disrupt the status quo of battery manufacturing. LeydenJar, also from Eindhoven, makes  silicon anodes  that can store up to 10 times more energy than traditional graphite anodes used in lithium-ion batteries.¬† \n Cambridge University spinoff Molyon has developed a  lithium-sulfur battery  that ¬†it claims delivers twice the energy density of lithium-ion. Sweden‚Äôs Enerpoly is building a factory that makes  zinc-ion batteries  for energy storage, which doesn‚Äôt rely on supplies of lithium. Netherlands-based CarbonX is developing alternative anode materials that could help wean Europe off  China-controlled  graphite.¬† \n While most of these startups are focusing on subcomponents, there may also be a place for bigger players.  \n A route to battery independence \n France‚Äôs Verkor was arguably the only European contender to Northvolt. Backed by Renault, Verkor has secured ‚Ç¨3bn for a 16 GWh gigafactory in Dunkirk, set  to  produce batteries for 300,000 EVs annually when completed around 2028.¬† \n ‚ÄúEurope can build an end-to-end value chain for batteries; in fact, it has to ‚Äî  batteries are vital components of both climate and defence technologies on which our sovereignty depends ,‚Äù says  Vi≈°eviƒá.¬† \n For that, Europe will need to invest, otherwise its battery ambitions could end up going the way of Northvolt. That will require venture capital but also significant public funding.¬†¬† \n InoBat‚Äôs Bocek says that Europe needs to give automakers an incentive to buy local batteries, just like it did with feed-in tariffs for renewable energies a decade ago.  ‚ÄúFinancial support and fast-tracking of permitting is essential,‚Äù he says.¬†¬† \n Northvolt‚Äôs fall is a cautionary tale, but not the end of the road. If Europe wants battery sovereignty, it must act decisively, pouring funds where they‚Äôre needed most. While foreign powers like China will no doubt form part of Europe‚Äôs battery future for a while to come, the smartest move for Europe might not be to play catch up but to carve its own niche.¬†  \n Europe‚Äôs technological sovereignty¬†will be a hot topic at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

ETPs let investors buy and sell Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They are traded on stock exchanges and track the price of Bitcoin. \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     This enables investments in Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing a digital wallet or dealing with the complexities of buying Bitcoin directly. \n ‚Äú ETPs offer institutional investors a way of accessing crypto without exposing themselves to the risks inherent in investing natively,‚Äù Anthony Yeung , CCO of Coincover, told TNW. \n This type of investment vehicle is gaining momentum globally. Investors have already poured a combined  $50bn into BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETPs in the US.¬† \n ‚ÄúIf BlackRock‚Äôs success in the US is anything to go by, this will generate significant inflows of institutional cash [in Europe] ‚Äî positively impacting Bitcoin price and helping drive acceptance of crypto as an essential asset to hold in a balanced portfolio,‚Äù  Yeung said.¬† \n Europe‚Äôs ETP landscape \n While Europe was slower to adopt ETPs than the US, it is now catching up. That‚Äôs partly thanks to  the EU‚Äôs Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which entered force late last year.¬† \n The legislation provides a clear and structured framework for launching new products.   In the  US, oversight is more fragmented. \n Last year, Europe had $12bn of ETP assets under management. While that still paled in comparison to the US ($57bn), it represents a tenfold increase from 2020 levels.¬† \n In terms of investment options, though, Europe hosts 135 ETPs ‚Äî far more than the US (35).¬† \n The largest ETP issuers in Europe last year were the US-based CoinShares, Switzerland‚Äôs 21Shares, and London-headquartered ETC Group, according to  Track Insight . \n James Burnie, fintech expert at British law firm gunnercooke, told TNW that BlackRock‚Äôs entry into Europe‚Äôs maturing ETP market is an added boost for the sector. ‚ÄúIt gets traditional finance comfortable with dealing in crypto assets,‚Äù he said.¬† \n ‚ÄúHowever, given that the crypto markets are now already considered a mainstay of finance, such moves are now becoming less impactful,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSoon the scrutiny will be more on any large traditional player not being in the industry.‚Äù \n Habibi echoes Burnie‚Äôs sentiments about the sector‚Äôs maturity. She argues that BlackRock‚Äôs move speaks to a wider trend of ‚Äúblurring traditional finance with digital assets.‚Äù¬† \n ‚ÄúCrypto is becoming more aligned with everyday finance,‚Äù she said. \n                         \n\n                         \n                             \n                                 \n\n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                        Story by\n                                     \n\n                                     \n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n Geschwindt\n                                         \n                                     \n                                 \n\n                                \n                                                                     \n                                         \n\n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

Analysts have  linked  the slump to Tesla‚Äôs aging model lineup and growing backlash against CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs increasingly polarising behaviour.¬†¬† \n Whatever the reason,  Andrew Fellows, an  automotive and mobility expert at global tech  consultancy Star, told TNW he thinks the recent sales slide has opened ‚Äúa rare window of opportunity‚Äù for rival European carmakers to regain lost ground from Musk‚Äôs firm. \n Tesla‚Äôs Model Y has been the best-selling EV in Europe for two years in a row. But in February, both Volkswagen and the BMW Group (including Mini) overtook Tesla in total EV sales for the first time, according to data from Jato Dynamics.¬† \n The üíú of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sweden‚Äôs Polestar sold 2,000 cars, representing an 84% jump. The company has been  actively targeting  disgruntled Tesla owners with special offers on its EVs.¬† \n Tesla‚Äôs public image is suffering under Musk, whose role in the Trump administration and endorsement of Germany‚Äôs far-right AfD party have drawn widespread condemnation in Europe.¬† \n Tesla‚Äôs dealerships have been   vandalised .  Its cars have been set on fire. In one of the more dramatic expressions of outrage, political campaigners beamed an image of Musk   making a Nazi-like salute   alongside the word ‚ÄúHeil‚Äù onto Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory in Berlin. \n With Tesla fighting fires, now could be the opportune moment for European automakers to strike. However, they‚Äôll need to move quickly because Chinese car companies are looming large.¬† \n The EV challengers to Tesla \n ‚Äú Chinese EV brands are entering the European market at pace, offering strong performance, advanced software and aggressive pricing,‚Äù said Fellows. ‚ÄúWhile they still lack the branding power of their European rivals, they‚Äôre moving fast and learning quickly.‚Äù \n In February, BYD‚Äôs EV sales in Europe almost doubled from the same month last year. Combined,  Chinese-owned brands, including BYD, Xpeng, and Leapmotor, sold more electric cars than Tesla, according to  Jato Dynamics . \n Dr Henning Dransfeld, an Austrian automotive expert and a director at software firm Infor, told TNW that the rise of Chinese EVs presented a ‚Äúfundamental threat‚Äù to European carmakers.¬† \n ‚ÄúWhile all eyes are on Tesla‚Äôs stumble, Chinese manufacturers are reshaping our industry‚Äôs competitive landscape,‚Äù he said.¬† \n Bolstered by strong state subsidies, Chinese automakers could surpass European brands, even with the EU‚Äôs  proposed tariffs  on Chinese-made EVs.¬† \n The only way for European carmakers to stay competitive, said Fellows, is to build better EVs and lower prices.¬† \n ‚ÄúEuropean manufacturers [need to] respond with more affordable models, smarter branding, and better software,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they hesitate, Chinese brands will seize the opportunity created by Tesla‚Äôs decline and Europe‚Äôs carmakers may find themselves chasing from behind once again.‚Äù \n                         \n\n                         \n                             \n                                 \n\n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                        Story by\n                                     \n\n                                     \n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n Geschwindt\n                                         \n                                     \n                                 \n\n                                \n                                                                     \n                                         \n\n                                         \n                                            Si√¥n is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

The  S9+ Coalition  ‚Äî¬†founded to give startups a voice in the policy agenda of the D9+ ‚Äî warned that Europe‚Äôs ‚Äúexcessive and fragmented regulation‚Äù has become a self-imposed barrier. \n The üíú of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sign up now! ‚ÄúIf this declaration is to matter, the next step is clear: D9+ countries must push their colleagues in the [European] Council to simplify, harmonise, and reduce the burden of EU digital regulation ‚Äî and to make Europe more attractive for investment in innovation,‚Äù Peter Kofler, chairman of S9+ member Danish Entrepreneurs, told TNW. \n The S9+ argues that startups are the foundation of economic growth. The claim is based on solid ground. According to Dealroom.co, just 0.01% of companies create 34% of all economic value ‚Äî and they all start as  startups . \n Europe, however,  has struggled  to turn promising companies into big businesses. Not a single EU company started from scratch in the last 50 years has a market capitalisation over ‚Ç¨100 billion. In the same period, all six US companies with a valuation above ‚Ç¨1 trillion were created. \n Hopes and fears for EU startups \n In recent years,  Europe  has fallen further behind the US in productivity and suffered from a declining share of global tech revenue. The continent‚Äôs leading startups now often look overseas to scale. Between 2008 and 2021, almost 30% of European startups valued at over $1 billion  relocated  their headquarters  abroad. The vast majority moved to the US.¬†¬† \n Many of their issues in Europe are attributed to stifling regulation. GDPR, for instance, cost small IT companies over 12% of their profits,  according to  estimates by three Oxford University economists. \n In  a declaration  of its own, the S9+ warned that ‚ÄúEurope cannot regulate its way out of stagnation.‚Äù \n The declaration proposes concrete actions to tackle the problem. Among its recommendations are rapidly implementing  the 28th regime  ‚Äî a proposed single set of rules for the entire EU ‚Äî¬†and providing tech-friendly zones, with regulatory ‚Äúsandboxes‚Äù alongside a gradual increase in regulatory requirements. \n AI regulation¬†is a particular concern for the S9+. The coalition urged the EU to develop a regulatory framework that fosters  AI  innovation while ensuring fair and open data access. New compliance frameworks, the S9+ stressed, should be restricted to what‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely necessary‚Äù ‚Äî¬†and only introduced after consulting startups. \n The S9+ also emphasised the need to focus on emerging companies, rather than prioritising the demands of traditional industry giants. \n ‚ÄúStartups are not asking for special treatment,‚Äù Kofler said. ‚ÄúWe are asking for a level playing field ‚Äî for access to capital, data, infrastructure, and markets. If Europe wants to close its  ‚Ç¨800 billion  investment gap, it won‚Äôt happen by giving old subsidies to old players.

In its aftermath, four scientists from the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London ‚Äî including two Greeks ‚Äî set out to answer a simple yet crucial question: why did some houses burn while others were left untouched? \n That question set off years of research into computer simulations for predicting wildfire risk and behaviour. In December 2023, the scientists founded Pinepeak to bring their idea out of the lab and into the market. \n Pinepeak‚Äôs wildfire prediction technology combines  machine learning  algorithms trained on satellite  data  with cutting-edge physics-based modelling originally developed for jet engine research at the University of Cambridge.¬† \n Just as turbulence and air movement dictate how fuel ignites in an engine, they also play a crucial role in the spread of wildfires. By modelling the chaotic nature of wildfire spread and how it interacts with other factors like terrain and weather, Pinepeak can arrive at more accurate forecasts.¬† \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     ‚ÄúCatastrophic wildfires are escalating due to climate change, but current risk assessment methods fall short of predicting how fires interact with their environment and spread from an ignition point towards communities,‚Äù Dr Savvas Gkantonas, CEO and co-founder of Pinepeak, told TNW.¬† \n Pinepeak COO and co-founder Dr Daniel Fredrich (left) and CEO and co-founder Dr Savvas Gkantonas. Credit: Pinepeak \n Pinepeak‚Äôs algorithms forecast the probability that a wildfire will occur with up to 90% accuracy. They also predict how fires will spread ‚Äî where they will go, what they will impact, and when all that might occur. The tool can do all this at an extremely high granularity, delivering wildfire risk forecasts down to the level of an individual home located anywhere in the world. \n Gkantonas said that this kind of intelligence is ‚Äúhighly valuable‚Äù to everyone from property insurers to national governments and firefighters.¬† \n Now, Pinepeak is looking to scale up. The startup has just been admitted to an accelerator that might enable it to do just that. \n Turning wildfire predictions into a successful startup \n Pinepeak is one of eight startups to have been picked for the University of Cambridge‚Äôs second START Accelerator programme. Alongside a ¬£40,000 upfront investment, the accelerator gives startups like Pinepeak access to mentorship from proven investors and founders.¬† \n Gkantonas said the programme¬† is ‚Äúhelping accelerate our growth by connecting us with early customers, domain experts, and seed investors, enabling us to grow faster and smarter.‚Äù Last month, the company also nabbed $322,000 ( ¬£250,000)  in pre-seed funding.¬† \n Other startups in the cohort include Podromic, which uses AI to predict dementia, and Trismik, which provides testing solutions for large language models (LLMs).¬† \n The startups are well located for success. Cambridge is the world‚Äôs third most valuable deep tech hub, only below Boston (Harvard, MIT, and Boston University) and the Bay Area, according to  Dealroom  data. \n Last year‚Äôs START Accelerator saw 11 companies participate, including lithium-sodium battery startup Molyon, which recently raised $4.6mn ( ¬£3.5mn) , as TNW  previously reported .¬† \n The search for Europe‚Äôs next big startups is the guiding mission of¬† TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

That‚Äôs according to its developer, UK startup Phasecraft.¬† \n The Bristol- and London-based company describes the breakthrough as the largest single leap in quantum simulations to date ‚Äî moving us a step closer to real-world quantum applications. \n Quantum computers improve on classical simulations by accurately modelling complex quantum behaviours ‚Äî like the ever-changing interactions between molecules or the evolution of materials over time ‚Äî that are too difficult for classical computers to simulate efficiently.  \n This could lead to technological leaps in various fields, from energy to manufacturing and medicine. For example, quantum computers could simulate materials in a battery far more accurately than ever before, enabling scientists to  design materials  that store energy more efficiently, last longer, and charge faster. \n Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sj√∂holm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper \n                         Take me there \n                     Currently, quantum computers are not yet fast enough to make those world-changing calculations. Phasecraft‚Äôs new  algorithm , called THRIFT, promises to accelerate the process. By optimising quantum simulation, THRIFT enables scientists to model new materials and chemicals faster and more accurately, even on today‚Äôs slow machines. \n In tests, THRIFT improved simulation estimates for a key benchmark in quantum physics ‚Äî the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model ‚Äî by a factor of 10. The advance enables simulations that are 10 times larger and can run 10 times longer than those produced by standard methods. The findings were published in  Nature Communications  today. \n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve managed to show a 10x increase on today‚Äôs machines, and we‚Äôd expect this to only get better as the hardware advances and quantum computers become better at tolerating errors and handling more complex calculations,‚Äù  Raul Santos, Phasecraft‚Äôs lead quantum scientist, told TNW. \n The future of quantum simulations \n In the last year or so, the obscure world of quantum computing has emerged from the lab and entered the public domain ‚Äî fuelled by Big Tech‚Äôs  recent progress  in quantum processors.

Is this the future of car sharing?", "intro": "Vay's remote-driven cars could offer a superior form of car sharing, but in Europe the service is stuck in a traffic jam of red tape", "date": "April 3, 2025 - 3:58 pm", "body": "‚ÄúHello, I will be your driver for today,‚Äù says Bartek Szurgot, a software engineer at German startup Vay and my chauffeur for this ride. He disengages the handbrake, gently presses the accelerator and the new Kia Niro EV I‚Äôm sitting in slowly pulls out of the parking lot.¬†¬†¬† \n As we approach the first intersection, Bartek indicates, turns the steering wheel, makes his observations, and drives out onto a busy road near the centre of Berlin. So far, pretty standard  ‚Äî except for one big difference. \n Bartek isn‚Äôt in the car. He‚Äôs in an office a few blocks away, controlling the vehicle like a high-tech puppeteer. \n \n Remote operators like  Bartek  command Vay‚Äôs cars  from a video game-style  station equipped with a driver‚Äôs seat, steering wheel, pedals, and three monitors providing visibility in front of the car and to its side.¬† \n TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20. \n                         Check It Out \n                     Road traffic sounds, such as emergency vehicle sirens and other warning signals, are transmitted via microphones to the teledriver‚Äôs headphones. Operators could be sitting on the other side of the world.¬† \n Vay has developed a proprietary hardware and  software  system called ‚Äúdrive-by-wire‚Äù that communicates with the car‚Äôs key controls, including the steering wheel, brake, and gear shifter. Electrical signals transmitted from the remote operating station tell the system what to do, enabling the car to mirror the remote driver‚Äôs actions in real time.¬† \n Redundant mobile networks  transmit the data. In the event of a network failure or emergency, the vehicle automatically comes to a safe stop. \n Vay‚Äôs remote drivers spend most of their time delivering vehicles to customers, who hail the cars on an app. After the car arrives, users take the wheel and drive themselves.¬† \n Teledrivers control the cars from remote locations. Credit: Si√¥n Geschwindt \n Customers can use the car for a short trip, hours, days, or even longer. Once they‚Äôre done, they stop the car safely in the road, apply the handbrake, get out, and carry on with their day. Then, a remote operator takes over again and drives on to the next client.¬†¬†¬† \n As anyone familiar with autonomous vehicles will know, watching a car drive itself takes some getting used to. Knowing that my ‚Äúdriver‚Äù was blocks away, steering through screens and sensors, made every turn feel surreal. But once you get used to it, the ride is almost disappointingly normal ‚Äî I suppose that‚Äôs the point.¬†¬† \n Vay‚Äôs tech is impressive, no doubt, but in Europe, regulators may strangle its potential before it ever scales. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Vay is accelerating. \n Vay already has  a 40-strong fleet of remote-controlled cars in Las Vegas. In Berlin and across Europe, though, progress has been slower, with no commercial service in place yet.¬† \n Due to regulatory red tape, Vay is limited to test drives only and is required to keep a safety driver onboard. It has previously received an exemption, though.  In 2023, it used one such regulatory hall pass to become  the first company  to operate a car on a European public road without a person inside. ¬† \n However, the German government hands out such permits sparingly. That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt take the wheel on our test drive. That was Graeme‚Äôs job, our safety driver for the trip. Nevertheless, it gave me a firm idea of what to expect. \n Cameras are attached to Vay‚Äôs cars. Credit: Si√¥n Geschwindt \n The future of car sharing? \n When I first heard of Vay‚Äôs remote driving concept a couple of years back, I was skeptical. The company touted the benefits: less hassle, cheaper fares, better working conditions for workers. But it seemed like a business model at risk of fading into irrelevancy once self-driving cars went mainstream. \n But with my mind fixated on the paradigms of ride-hailing on one hand and full autonomy on the other, I may have overlooked that Vay was doing something radically different. \n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating a whole new category of mobility,‚Äù Thomas von der Ohe, Vay‚Äôs CEO  and co-founder, tells me from the company‚Äôs headquarters in Berlin. After spending years  in the Bay area building self-driving cars, he came back to Europe, founding Vay in 2018 alongside Fabrizio Scelsi and Bogdan Djukic.¬† \n Vay‚Äôs rides in Las Vegas cost about half as much as  Uber . Von der Ohe says they keep prices low by reducing driver labour costs. With ride-hailing services, it‚Äôs one driver, one car. But a single Vay driver can oversee up to 10 vehicles on any given day. When they drop one car at a customer, the drivers can ‚Äúteleport‚Äù and gain control of another vehicle.¬† \n Vay could offer a taxi-style service where passengers ride in the back, but that would cut into profits and drive up prices. That‚Äôs why letting customers drive themselves makes business sense, says Von der Ohe.¬† \n Vay aims to make its biggest impact in car sharing and rentals, not ride-hailing. Von der Ohe says the company can match average car rental prices in Germany while helping rental firms cut costs by reducing the need for large parking facilities, especially at busy airports.¬† \n Vay also hopes to provide a better version of car sharing. Customers don‚Äôt need to pick up or park their cars ‚Äî major hassles in dense European cities. Fleet owners can keep vehicles in use longer, and Von der Ohe believes the model could even reduce private car ownership in urban areas.¬† \n All this makes for a compelling value proposition. Vay has raised $150mn in funding so far, including  ‚Ç¨34mn  ($37mn) from  the European Investment Bank.¬† \n But there are still many potholes in the road. Outside Las Vegas, Vay is still unproven ‚Äî and regulatory red tape isn‚Äôt making things easier.¬† \n In Europe, governments have been slow to adopt rules for remotely driven cars. Currently, the vehicles are subject to much the same guidelines as autonomous vehicles ‚Äî which are patchy at best. ¬† \n ‚ÄúWe have the tech, it works, it could be all over Berlin and Europe,‚Äù says Von der Ohe. ‚ÄúBut politics get in the way, there‚Äôs no consensus. It‚Äôs just so weird.‚Äù¬† \n Vay has completed over 10,000 trips in Vegas and  plans to scale its fleet of remote-controlled Kia Niros to 100 this year.  The company  recently secured a new production facility in Sin City where it will retrofit the cars with its drive-by-wire system and a relatively inexpensive set of cameras. To fund the expansion, the company is also lining up another funding round, says Von der Ohe. \n After my test drive, I called an Uber to take me to Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

The ballooning of DOGE‚Äôs presence at the federal agency‚Äîwhich Bloomberg, citing sworn statements filed in federal court Wednesday, previously  reported ‚Äîcomes as Musk and his cohorts are publicly  threatening social security benefits , citing unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud. The DOGE-affiliated personnel in question are currently listed in the agency‚Äôs internal organizational chart. Background checks for two are still pending, according to a  filing  by the SSA in federal court in Maryland opposing a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by unions that would prevent DOGE from accessing SSA records. (A  sworn statement  attached to the filing from the SSA‚Äôs deputy commissioner of human resources claims that six of the background checks are still pending.) The operatives‚Äîwhom the government did not name in its filing‚Äîare, according to internal documents, Akash Bobba, Scott Coulter, Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, Antonio Gracias, Gautier Cole Killian, Jon Koval, Nikhil Rajpal, Payton Rehling, and Ethan Shaotran. This team appears to be among the largest DOGE units deployed to any government agency. Ten of the DOGE-affiliated staffers are listed as part of the same group within Microsoft Teams, which SSA employees use for internal communication, according to a screenshot shared with WIRED. They are listed as ‚ÄúIT Specialists‚Äù based at the agency‚Äôs headquarters in Washington, DC, except for Bobba, who is listed as ‚ÄúFront Office‚Äù in the office of the chief information officer (CIO). Many of them have worked or interned at Musk companies such as Tesla and Space X, and the majority of them have also appeared at other government agencies in recent weeks, as part of  DOGE‚Äôs incursion into the government . Musk has made wild claims about the social security system, calling it a ‚ÄúPonzi scheme‚Äù and falsely claiming that  millions of 150-year-olds were fraudulently collecting benefits . Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 and davidgilbert.01. According to the SSA court filing and accompanying  sworn   statements , seven of them have read-only access to several datasets including the  Master Beneficiary Record , which contains detailed information about individuals and their benefits. Those same DOGE representatives also have read-only access to Numident, a database containing information about everyone who‚Äôs ever applied for a Social Security number, as well as data referred to as ‚ÄúTreasury Payment Files Showing SSA Payments from SSOARS.‚Äù (The Social Security Online Accounting and Reporting System is a set of systems containing ‚Äúinformation on the SSA‚Äôs financial position and operations,‚Äù  according  to the SSA.) These records contain a great deal of personally identifying and financial information; in filings the government says DOGE accessing them is necessary to ‚Äúdetect fraud.‚Äù While it‚Äôs been unclear even to well-placed insiders what specifically DOGE is doing inside the Social Security Administration, Musk has repeatedly voiced his desire to  ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù  large parts of the system in the US, recently claiming that the fact that there are more Social Security numbers than there are US citizens‚Äîa  well-known quirk  of the SSA system‚Äî ‚Äúmight be the biggest fraud in history .‚Äù Sources have told WIRED that one of the tasks the DOGE cohort will be assigned is how people identify themselves to access their benefit payments. Experts with decades of experience at the agency are now worried that DOGE operatives working across multiple agencies increases the risk of SSA data being shared outside of the agency or that their inexperience will lead to them breaking systems entirely. In the SSA filing, lawyers for the agency claim that the DOGE operatives have ‚Äúno access to SSA production automation, code, or configuration files.‚Äù A  previous sworn statement from Tiffany Flick , the agency‚Äôs former acting chief of staff, claims that its CIO, Michael Russo, was DOGE-aligned and demanded that Bobba be given access to ‚Äúeverything, including source code.‚Äù Last month, President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration  appointed Russo  as the SSA‚Äôs new CIO, despite his having no apparent previous government experience. Russo came to DOGE from payments company Shift4, which was founded by Jared Isaacman, Trump‚Äôs nominee to run NASA. The office of the CIO works on ‚Äúimplementation of a comprehensive systems configuration management, database management and data administration program,‚Äù according to the agency‚Äôs own website, and is responsible for strategic planning. According to an  affidavit filed on Friday as part of a lawsuit  designed to halt what the suit called DOGE‚Äôs ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù seizure of SSA data, Flick outlined how she tried to educate Russo on how information at SSA is handled and the measures in place to prevent fraud. ‚ÄúMr Russo seemed completely focused on questions ‚Ä¶ based on the general myth of supposed widespread social security fraud, rather than facts,‚Äù Flick said, adding that Russo was unwilling to understand SSA‚Äôs complex systems and instead seemed fixated on conspiracy theories about fraud within the system, such as Musk‚Äôs claim that millions of  150-year-olds were receiving benefit payments . Flick also wrote that she was ‚Äúnot confident‚Äù that DOGE operatives had ‚Äúthe requisite knowledge and training to prevent sensitive information from being inadvertently transferred to bad actors.‚Äù Flick‚Äôs affidavit named Coulter and Bobba as two of the DOGE associates joining SSA, alongside Russo. Coulter was a New York‚Äìbased hedge fund manager whose fund, Cowbird Capital, was shuttered last year,  according to Business Insider . (Coulter appears to be the DOGE lead at SSA. While the affidavit from the deputy commissioner of human resources doesn‚Äôt name him, it does identify the lead as a worker detailed from NASA, and Coulter is the only one of the 10 DOGE workers listed in internal NASA records reviewed by WIRED.) Gracias, another private equity figure who is now part of the  DOGE team at SSA , is the founder of Valor Equity Partners. Men named Jon Koval and Payton Rehling are listed on Valor's website as a vice president and a data engineer, respectively. Gracias, Koval, and Rehling don‚Äôt seem to have any prior government experience, but Gracias does have a long history with Musk‚Äîhe worked at Tesla for 14 years as a company director and helped Musk take the company public. Gracias spent time with Musk at Mar-a-Lago ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration and later described their conversations about how they believed the government functioned, on the  All In  podcast. (‚ÄúIt's broken now. And so literally, money is flowing out,‚Äù went one confusing Gracias claim, about how money is moving from the Treasury department to other agencies.) Later, Gracias mentioned ‚Äã‚Äãthe SSA. ‚ÄúThe only audit that I've seen is actually from the Social Security Administration. When you read it, I've got one of the partners who have read the thing, it's just riddled with material weaknesses.‚Äù Many of the other DOGE names listed in SSA‚Äôs internal records have  previously been reported by WIRED  as young, inexperienced technologists working at other government agencies. Individuals having access to the records of multiple agencies is highly unusual and problematic, experts say. ‚ÄúFederal law places strict controls on personal data held by agencies, including limits on cross-agency transfers and rigorous training requirements for personnel who have a legitimate need for access,‚Äù says John Davisson, the director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ‚ÄúIgnoring those safeguards and haphazardly putting systems at multiple agencies under the thumb of a single engineer obliterates those protections. They‚Äôre hotwiring the federal government with a total disregard for privacy and data security.‚Äù Bobba, a former Palantir intern and recent UC Berkeley graduate,  was first appointed to the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) before moving to the General Services Administration (GSA). According to Flick‚Äôs testimony, ‚ÄúThere were challenges with Mr. Bobba‚Äôs background check that took a few days to resolve.‚Äù Flick did not expand on what those issues were but stated that Bobba was eventually granted access to sensitive SSA systems after Russo and Musk lieutenant Steve Davis directly pressured top SSA administrators. The acting commissioner was ultimately replaced by Leland Dudek, a mid-level staffer who was, Flick asserted, on leave after having communicated with DOGE outside normal channels‚Äîsomething he later bragged about in a LinkedIn post. Farritor , a 23-year-old former Thiel Fellow and Space X intern who helped to recruit other young engineers to join DOGE on a Discord group for SpaceX interns, has also appeared internally at the GSA, the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Education. Rajpal, a former Twitter and Tesla employee, now at the SSA, has also appeared  at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , OPM, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. WIRED previously reported  that Elez, a 25-year-old engineer also on the SSA list, at one point had read and write access within the federal payment system at the Treasury Department. He was also deployed¬†at Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security, according to  The New York Times . Elez briefly  resigned from DOGE  after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by  The Wall Street Journal,  but returned after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X. Shaotran, another young DOGE employee, is a 22-year-old Harvard student and a runner-up at an xAI hackathon. (xAI is Musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company.) He has been deployed at GSA and the Department of Education and was recently onboarded at the  Department of Housing and Urban Development , according to internal documentation. Killian is a 24-year-old former computer science student who matriculated at McGill University and has been part of DOGE‚Äôs work at  the Environmental Protection Agency  and GSA, as well as the SSA. The SSA did not respond to a request from WIRED about what the DOGE operatives are working on inside the agency. In a Tuesday meeting, United States DOGE Service administrator Amy Gleason told staff that Musk-affiliated engineers and some legacy USDS workers would be headed to SSA to improve ‚Äúidentity proofing,‚Äù say sources who were in the meeting. The US DOGE Service is a permanent rebranding of the US Digital Service. Identity proofing is the process SSA uses to identify that users are who they say they are in order to access their benefits. The process includes registering with identity apps such as the government‚Äôs own Login.gov or third-party services such as ID.me. At a meeting last week,  according to The Washington Post , Dudek, the SSA‚Äôs acting commissioner, told staff that the ‚ÄúDOGE people‚Äù were effectively in charge of day-to-day operations at the agency and ‚Äúwere going to make mistakes.‚Äù He also made it clear that he had been in direct contact with the White House. ‚ÄúI work for the president,‚Äù Dudek said, according to a longer recording of the meeting  obtained by ProPublica . ‚ÄùI need to do what the president tells me to do. I‚Äôve had to make some tough choices, choices I didn‚Äôt agree with, but the president wanted it, and I did it.‚Äù In February, Dudek outlined plans to  fire 7,000 employees  at the SSA and close more than half of the agency‚Äôs regional offices, while  confirming  that many of the SSA‚Äôs most senior staff were departing. This week, the agency  reportedly  gave up on the idea of fully abandoning phone service for clients after The Washington Post reported on the plan. The SSA houses a highly complex system built on decades-old technology and contains some of the most sensitive personal information held anywhere within the US government. The threat posed by DOGE engineers making mistakes within these systems, experts say, is huge. Martin O‚ÄôMalley, a former SSA commissioner,  warned last week , following DOGE‚Äôs incursion, that within months the SSA system could ‚Äùcollapse‚Äù and recipients would see ‚Äúan interruption of benefits.\" This warning was repeated by Flick, who wrote in her affidavit that DOGE‚Äôs lack of knowledge of the SSA systems, ‚Äúcombined with the significant loss of expertise as more and more agency personnel leave, have me seriously concerned that SSA programs will continue to function and operate without disruption.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a valid fear that personally identifiable information will be exfiltrated or source code messed with without necessary controls and rigor,‚Äù John McGing, a former SSA employee who worked at the agency for almost four decades, tells WIRED. Additionally, DOGE has  imposed a $1 spending limit on federal credit cards , which has led to some regional SSA offices experiencing issues buying basic supplies, including paper and toner, according to details shared with WIRED by one SSA employee. ‚ÄúWe have started rationing paper,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúPeople like to ask for four copies of their benefit verification letter. We‚Äôve been giving them one and telling them to make their own copies.‚Äù The provision of sign language interpreters for appointments at the SSA have also been interrupted due to the $1 spending limit. ‚ÄúWe have to go back to that client and tell them we can‚Äôt provide an interpreter, even though everything on our website says we will provide that,‚Äù the source said, citing an incident that happened this week. SSA staff are also now unable to order death certificates, which are used to verify whether someone within the system is dead or not, according to an email reviewed by WIRED. The source added that the office is also unable to pay the company that shreds mountains of documents it prints out on a daily basis, raising fears that piles of paper with highly sensitive personally identifiable information could soon be left lying around the office.

Few of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nation‚Äôs code base‚Äîor, better yet, scrap it altogether. Musk wasn‚Äôt big on formalities, but he‚Äôd dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest. The social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called  Department of Government Efficiency , sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phone‚Äîtalking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building‚Äôs Secretary of War Suite. He‚Äôd even had his video-gaming rig installed there. As Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal government‚Äîpeople like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Musk‚Äôs acquisition, where he‚Äôd once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto ‚ÄúFutuate cohortem urbanam‚Äù‚ÄîLatin for something like ‚ÄúFuck these city dwellers.‚Äù In Musk‚Äôs mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the government‚Äôs byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. They‚Äôd help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton:  Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms?  They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then:  What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs? In the days and weeks that followed, DOGE hit one part of the federal government after another. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Veterans Affairs; the Federal Aviation, General Services, Social Security, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric administrations; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service; the US Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Park Service and the National Science Foundation‚Äîall fell under Musk‚Äôs control. An estimated tens of thousands of federal employees were effectively fired or resigned. ‚ÄúThis is a digital coup,‚Äù one USAID source told WIRED at the time. Got a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32, velliott88.18, dell.3030, DavidGilbert.01, Kateknibbs.09, or dmehro.89. Along the way, DOGE also gained access to untold terabytes of data. Trump had given Musk and his operatives carte blanche to tap any unclassified system they pleased. One of their first stops: a database previously breached more than a decade ago by alleged Chinese cyberspies that contained investigative files on tens of millions of US government employees. Other storehouses thrown open to DOGE may have included federal workers‚Äô tax records, biometric data, and private medical histories, such as treatment for drug and alcohol abuse; the cryptographic keys for restricted areas at federal facilities across the country; the personal testimonies of low-income-housing recipients; and granular detail on the locations of particularly vulnerable children. What did DOGE want with this kind of information? None of it seemed relevant to Musk‚Äôs stated aim of identifying waste and fraud, multiple government finance, IT, and security specialists told WIRED. But in treating the US government itself as a giant dataset, the experts said, DOGE could help the Trump administration accomplish another goal: to gather much of what the government knows about a given individual, whether a civil servant or an undocumented immigrant, in one easily searchable place. WIRED spoke with more than 150 current and former federal employees, experts, and Musk supporters across more than 20 agencies to expose the inner workings of DOGE. Many of these sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about what DOGE has done‚Äîand what it might do next. Illustration: Sam Lyon Musk and Trump‚Äôs  relationship was cemented on July 13, 2024, when a would-be assassin came within inches of killing the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk was impressed by the photo of Trump, blood streaming down his face, raising his fist in the air and shouting ‚ÄúFight, fight, fight‚Äù for the cameras. The image quickly became a meme‚ÄîMusk‚Äôs love language. He endorsed Trump that day and pivoted his recently launched super PAC to get the former president reelected. The following month, during a live discussion on X, Musk floated the idea of working for Trump on a ‚Äúgovernment efficiency commission.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs response was enthusiastic. ‚ÄúYou're the greatest cutter,‚Äù he said admiringly. Two years earlier, after Musk purchased Twitter in a chaotic blitz of last-minute paperwork and hundred-million-dollar money transfers, he had cut roughly 80 percent of the company‚Äôs staff, closed at least a dozen international offices, and rolled back Twitter‚Äôs content moderation policies in the name of free speech. He demanded change at such speed that one of his lieutenants, Steve Davis, took to sleeping at Twitter‚Äôs San Francisco headquarters with his partner and their newborn baby. In Washington, Musk estimated that his team could cut ‚Äúnearly $2 trillion‚Äù from the federal budget. After you set aside nondiscretionary spending such as Medicare and Social Security benefits and interest payments on the national debt, that number, $2 trillion, was a little more than what you had left over. In other words, Musk was functionally proposing to cut  everything  else, from foreign aid to housing subsidies, from the maintenance of national parks to the collection of basic weather data, from investigations into predatory lenders to the operation of air traffic control systems. After Trump won, he announced that Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, would colead DOGE. The announcement kicked off a stealthy recruiting process, led by Davis, the same executive who‚Äôd slept at Twitter HQ. Musk pictured a team of super-high-IQ individuals joining him in Washington for an 80-hour-a-week, 18-month hackathon on the US government. The DOGE brain trust camped out on the eighth floor of the SpaceX office in Washington, DC, commandeering multiple conference rooms and conducting meetings and interviews with DOGE hopefuls, according to a person with knowledge of the events. One question for applicants: Who did you vote for in 2024? Among Davis‚Äô early recruits was Zsombor (Anthony) Jancso, a San Francisco‚Äìbased engineer and former Palantir employee in his mid-twenties. After Palantir, Jancso had worked on a project called Accelerate X, which purported to offer ‚Äúa modern OS for government‚Äù with solutions ‚Äúdelivered in days.‚Äù His cofounder, an MIT-educated engineer named Jordan Wick, joined DOGE too. A few weeks after the 2024 election, an online handle associated with Jancso reached out to a group of people who had participated in an AI challenge put on by the US Space Force. The person said they were looking for ‚Äúhardcore engineers‚Äù and instructed applicants to send their GitHub or LinkedIn to @DOGE on X and reply privately with their X handle. (To do all this, they‚Äôd need to pay for  X premium .) Not long after that, the same handle posted in a group for Palantir alums: ‚ÄúThis is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3.‚Äù Luke Farritor, a 23-year-old engineer, quickly joined in the DOGE recruitment effort. The son of an academic at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a physician, Farritor was homeschooled and filled his childhood bedroom with books by James Baldwin and Jordan Peterson. During college he got prestigious internships at SpaceX and took to wearing his SpaceX T-shirt all the time. Later, Farritor came to a certain nerdy prominence for his role in using machine learning to decipher an ancient papyrus charred by the same volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii. He said his work received support from a $2 million gift from the Musk Foundation, and Musk backed it on X. The papyrus project also helped earn Farritor a Thiel Fellowship last spring‚Äîa $100,000 grant funded by the oligarch and meant to encourage bright young people to drop out of college, which Farritor promptly did. On December 5, Farritor posted in a Discord group for SpaceX interns, noting that DOGE was looking for ‚Äúskilled software engineers (and ops people) at any career stage who are willing to work for ~6mo in person in DC. Paid.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to fix the government!‚Äù Musk, meanwhile, was spending time at Mar-a-Lago and getting a crash course on American civics, as taught by an array of Washington bureaucrats, venture capitalists, and right-wing shitposters on X. One of Musk‚Äôs advisers was Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor and early Tesla backer, who later summarized what they‚Äôd learned on a podcast: ‚ÄúA department just basically asks for money from Treasury and they send it out.‚Äù Of course, the truth was a lot more complicated. Before the Treasury cuts a check, the payment authorization has to pass through an array of bespoke technical systems built up over decades to ensure that the money Congress appropriates is properly spent by the executive branch. The system is inefficient by design, so as to provide backstop after backstop. To Musk, that meant it was ripe for disruption. (His adviser Gracias would go on to become a DOGE ‚ÄúIT specialist‚Äù at the Social Security Administration.) Still, Musk seemed to grasp that he‚Äôd been cavalier in setting his goal at $2 trillion. Government spending factors into gross domestic product; that level of cutting, the economist Dean Baker told WIRED, would represent a hit to the economy akin to the 2008 financial crisis, with the potential to produce double-digit unemployment. By mid-January, Musk  suggested  that $1 trillion‚Äîa sum merely greater than the entirety of nondefense discretionary spending‚Äîwas a reasonable aim. He started to home in on individual government agencies. He seemed especially eager to eviscerate USAID, the government‚Äôs primary instrument for foreign aid. The right-wing conspiracy theories he‚Äôd eventually repost on X portrayed it as a criminal enterprise, a tool of the deep state‚Äôs woke agenda. As Trump‚Äôs second inauguration drew near, Musk‚Äôs and Ramaswamy‚Äôs visions for DOGE started to sharply diverge. Ramaswamy advocated an incremental approach: Push for changes in law that would eventually cut off spending at the source. Musk didn‚Äôt want to wait around for that. Increasingly, his plans seemed in line with a scheme that incoming vice president JD Vance had laid out in a podcast interview in 2021: Fire all midlevel civil servants and replace them with Trump loyalists. Just before Trump officially took office, Musk‚Äôs vision won out, and Ramaswamy left the organization. Trump officially established DOGE on the afternoon of his inauguration. He effectively pasted it on top of the US Digital Service, an Obama-era agency set up to attract private-sector talents into a few years of civil work. Now the  D  in USDS would stand for ‚ÄúDOGE.‚Äù The order also established another organization within it‚Äîthe US DOGE Service Temporary Organization‚Äîthat would expire on July 4, 2026. This would give DOGE the ability to bring in special government employees, people who would serve for a limited time before returning to the private sector and who, critically, would not be subject to the same transparency requirements as regular government workers. As Trump‚Äôs presidency began, the DOGE brain trust broke camp at SpaceX¬†headquarters in DC. An employee who was there says they left a men‚Äôs bathroom ‚Äútrashed.‚Äù One of the urinals was ‚Äúfilled with gum and Zyn.‚Äù Illustration: Sam Lyon Daisy Kid Henderson  first heard from DOGE around 9:30 pm on Inauguration Day, when she received an email inviting her to a meeting with anonymous staffers the following afternoon. Henderson, a fiery 28-year-old software engineer at the USDS, describes herself as an ‚Äúeternal optimist.‚Äù Still, she found the lack of names on the invite disconcerting. Henderson, who is based in Denver, had been working for the USDS since January 2024. She landed there after a seven-year stint at Comcast, where her job involved everything from quantum computing to robotics to an audio algorithm for filtering sounds that people with PTSD or autism might find triggering. For Henderson, USDS was a chance to take a breath and reevaluate her career while doing some good. ‚ÄúIt was my dream job,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúWhen I was hired on, it was even better than I imagined.‚Äù Henderson had overseen three generative AI pilot programs at the Department of Homeland Security. One, created for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, helped local officials plan and apply for disaster aid funding. She also partnered with the Food and Nutrition Service to help a number of states more quickly deliver assistance to low-income families. By the time Henderson‚Äôs appointment with DOGE rolled around, she recalls, ‚Äúthey had been doing these meetings all day nonstop.‚Äù DOGE ‚Äúhad four or five interviewers and worked in shifts,‚Äù Henderson says, likely in an attempt to churn through all 200 legacy USDS employees as quickly as possible. According to another USDS staffer, someone had tried asking the interviewers for their last names, and the reply had been: ‚ÄúThis is a one-way conversation. We won't be answering any questions.‚Äù One question the DOGE people seemed to be asking everyone:  What do you think about DOGE? Henderson tried to stay positive as her call with the two young DOGE operatives began. They introduced themselves by their first names only, Cole and Ram. (That was Cole Killian, a 24-year-old who had attended McGill University, and Nikhil Rajpal, the former college libertarian and X employee.) As the men asked Henderson about her projects, they seemed particularly interested in her AI-related work for FEMA and her technical abilities. Then the questions took a strange turn‚Äîcentering around ‚Äúwho the underperformers are at USDS,‚Äù Henderson recalls, and what skills she brought to her role. At one point, Killian simply got up and walked out of the room without a word. Rajpal carried on as though nothing had happened. Afterward, Henderson learned her colleagues had been asked whether they should keep their jobs. Similarly strange meetings were going on at the General Services Administration, another early DOGE target. If OPM was the federal government‚Äôs HR department, GSA was the operations and IT departments rolled into one. It oversaw more than 1,000 federally owned buildings, from anonymous office parks to minimalist masterpieces, along with hundreds of thousands of government vehicles and tens of billions in annual government purchasing. As would happen at agencies across the government, the GSA seizure took place in the shadows‚Äîa matter not of announcements but of calendar invitations from unknown people, of unfamiliar names appearing in internal directories. The sixth and seventh floors, which had offices and suites used by the administrator, the ‚ÄúA-suite,‚Äù were restricted and largely locked down. No longer could employees simply badge in through the turnstile. Now they had to pass through metal detectors and have their belongings x-rayed. During that first week, GSA employees caught a glimpse of a whiteboard sitting in a large, vacant room with three items written on it: Spending Cuts $585 m Regulations Removed 15 Square feet sold/terminated 203,000 sf. No one in the rank and file seemed to know who wrote it or what it meant. As one of Musk‚Äôs top operatives at the GSA, DOGE installed Nicole Hollander‚ÄîSteve Davis‚Äô partner, the other parent of the newborn who slept at Twitter HQ. A former Tesla software engineer, Thomas Shedd, became the director of the GSA‚Äôs Technology Transformation Services, which operates dozens of crucial systems used across government agencies, including Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and the Federal Procurement Data System, a database that makes all unclassified government contracts above the micropayment level freely available to the public. DOGE‚Äôs strike force at GSA included Coristine, the young engineer known as ‚ÄúBig Balls,‚Äù and Farritor, the papyrus whiz kid. Another young DOGE recruit, Ethan Shaotran, also got a GSA email account and A-suite clearance. Shaotran had recently served as the president of Harvard‚Äôs mountaineering club. He‚Äôd drifted into DOGE‚Äôs orbit at a hackathon for xAI, another company Musk owns. Soon it became clear that DOGE wanted GSA to adopt one product in particular: an AI chatbot that could plug into the agency‚Äôs main portal, the Enterprise Data Solution. Such a tool would allow a handful of DOGE technicians to ask questions in plain language and get answers from vast stores of government data. (How this would accord with the GSA‚Äôs Internal Data Sharing Policy, which mandates that requests for certain kinds of controlled unclassified information must be approved by supervisors, was unclear.) To DOGE operatives unfamiliar with GSA‚Äôs systems, this might have seemed like a quick build‚Äîparticularly if the team used an off-the-shelf large language model, like Claude or Gemini or Llama, as a starting point. But the engineers at GSA knew the project DOGE had in mind was far more complex than it seemed. The Enterprise Data Solution is a maze of disparate databases, analytical tools, and machine-learning systems, all with tightly controlled permissions. Creating even a quick chatbot that could tap into these datasets and produce useful answers was anything but trivial. During the Biden administration, employees at TTS had started exploring the possibility of building a simpler chatbot called GSAi, which they hoped would increase productivity by helping people write emails and eventually process contract and procurement data. By the end of Biden‚Äôs term, though, there was no GSA chatbot on the horizon. ‚ÄúAnyone can build a chatbot today; it's really not that interesting,‚Äù a data scientist remarked during a February meeting about GSAi. A version of it‚Äîone that wasn‚Äôt directly connected to EDS‚Äîwas set to go live soon. ‚ÄúThe interesting part is in the quality. Can we build a high-quality chatbot, one where our domain expertise is being applied?‚Äù To bridge the gap, GSA engineers proposed building what they called a discovery layer, an intermediary designed to decode user queries, identify relevant data sources, and generate precise searches that returned data the AI could interpret. The proposal, pitched to the A-suite‚Äîthe select group that sources say includes DOGE members like Davis and Hollander‚Äîwould also give GSA the ability to audit queries and check the quality of the responses. But for that to work, every database would need to be mapped, its columns and metadata described and categorized, ensuring the system understood what data lived where. None of this would happen automatically. It would be a manual, painstaking process. As the GSA engineers discussed the scope of what needed to happen, according to sources familiar with the events, they seemed deflated. DOGE‚Äôs timeline was unrealistic. ‚ÄúThis is a multiyear play,‚Äù one employee said bluntly in a meeting about the project, ‚Äúand they think in terms of days and weeks.‚Äù A day after  the Alfalfa Club dinner, rumors were swirling that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would soon have its funding frozen. Grantees who already had their projects approved‚Äîstate and county governments, nonprofits‚Äîbegan aggressively drawing down their funding at an unprecedented scale. While HUD employees could have stopped the withdrawals, they didn't. And so, in the space of just a few days, around 1,400 grantees withdrew $1.5 billion in federal funding‚Äîfive times the normal rate, according to data compiled from the agency's banking system and shared with WIRED. For Musk to gain what he seemingly most wanted‚Äîa ‚Äúdelete‚Äù button he could wield against any agency by cutting off its funding at the source‚Äîhe would need direct access to the US Treasury. DOGE dispatched operatives to the Treasury‚Äôs Bureau of Fiscal Service, which controls more than $5 trillion in disbursements, including Social Security and Medicare payments, tax refunds, and the salaries of federal workers. The operatives wanted access to two key systems: the  Payment Automation Manager  and the  Secure Payment System . David Lebryk, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury,  retired  rather than comply. The financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk‚Äôs retirement gave him a ‚Äúpanic attack,‚Äù because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. Meanwhile, Farritor and a DOGE colleague had started showing up at USAID, one of Musk‚Äôs political b√™tes noires. They carried backpacks with six or seven laptops each, sources familiar with the events told WIRED, and were allegedly instructed to access ‚Äúemployee email accounts and all digital infrastructure,‚Äù according to a lawsuit later filed against DOGE on behalf of USAID employees. Initially turned away for lack of security clearance, they came back with a handwritten note on stationery from the Executive Office of the President saying they were suitable. On X, Musk called USAID a ‚Äúcriminal organization‚Äù and said it was ‚Äútime for it to die‚Äù; Trump alleged that the agency was ‚Äúrun by a bunch of radical lunatics.‚Äù According to  The Washington Post , Farritor and the other DOGE operative would run manually through payments, clicking off lifesaving programs. On February 3, Musk bragged that he had spent the weekend ‚Äúfeeding USAID into the wood chipper.‚Äù Soon afterward,  as WIRED first reported  on February 4, a 25-year-old former X engineer named Marko Elez was granted the ability not only to read the code in the Treasury systems but also to write‚Äîor change‚Äîit. With that level of access, he (or anyone he reported to) could potentially have cut off congressionally authorized payments, effectively allowing Trump or Musk to exercise a line-item veto. More immediately ominous to people familiar with the systems was the possibility that, by tampering with the code, Elez could cause the systems, in whole or in part, to simply stop working. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like knowing you have hackers on your network, but nobody lets you do anything about it,‚Äù a Treasury employee told WIRED. Illustration: Sam Lyon The fact of Elez‚Äôs read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention. Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, denied that DOGE had read/write access. In a  letter to Congress  that same day, Bessent wrote that members of the Treasury staff, including DOGE operative and Cloud Software Group CEO Thomas Krause, would have ‚Äúread-only access,‚Äù which they needed to ‚Äúcontinue this operational efficiency assessment.‚Äù But the letter didn‚Äôt mention Elez, whom a Treasury employee described to WIRED as the ‚Äúhands-on-keyboard‚Äù person. (White House officials have gone  back  and  forth  about DOGE‚Äôs access to Treasury payment systems. This issue ended up in the courts. The cases are ongoing.) By early February, Elez came under fire after  The Wall Street Journal  found racist comments from accounts linked to him on social media. One suggested that ‚Äú99%‚Äù of immigrant workers from India would be ‚Äúreplaced by slightly smarter‚Äù large language models. When the Journal asked whether Elez was connected to the account, he resigned. Later, with public support from Musk and Vice President Vance, DOGE rehired him. Before long, he was designated as an ‚ÄúIT specialist‚Äù at another target of Musk‚Äôs: the Social Security Administration. DOGE had installed  a handpicked chief information officer at the SSA‚Äîthe former CTO of a payments company headed by Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who once commanded two trips to space using SpaceX rockets and is Trump‚Äôs current nominee to lead NASA. That new CIO, Michael Russo, had asked to bring on Akash Bobba, the former Palantir intern who had been working out of OPM, as an engineer. But there were ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù with Bobba‚Äôs background check, Tiffany Flick, the acting chief of staff to the acting administrator, later stated in a sworn affidavit given in a suit against the SSA. Bobba wasn‚Äôt brought on immediately. By February 10, seven days after he was requested to be onboarded, phone calls and emails started to come in‚Äîfrom Russo, Steve Davis, and others‚Äîmaking clear that Bobba was to be given access to SSA systems and data by the end of the day. As Russo and Davis ‚Äúgrew increasingly impatient‚Äù that evening, Flick recalled, Bobba was sworn in over the phone at 9 pm. Initially, Flick and officials from the CIO‚Äôs office determined that Bobba would be given anonymized, read-only access to records in the Numerical Identification System, which contains information on everyone who has ever applied for a Social Security number. On February 15, Bobba reported that there were issues with the dataset he‚Äôd been provided. Russo demanded that Bobba be given full access to ‚Äúeverything, including source code,‚Äù Flick recalled. This included the SSA‚Äôs Enterprise Data Warehouse, which contains the ‚Äúnames of spouses and dependents, work history, financial and banking information, immigration or citizenship status, and marital status,‚Äù according to Flick‚Äôs affidavit. Later that day, the chief information officer for the whole federal government‚Äîa political appointee working out of the Office of Management and Budget‚Äîissued an opinion to Russo granting Bobba the access. Flick retired. In her affidavit, she expressed serious concerns about the potential for SSA records to be ‚Äúinadvertently transferred to bad actors‚Äù and about ‚Äúincredibly complex web of systems‚Äù being ‚Äúbroken by inadvertent user error.‚Äù Over at the USDS, Daisy Kid Henderson had decided it was time for her to leave too. Since DOGE‚Äôs takeover, Henderson and her colleagues had had little contact with their new overlords. Each day, the legacy employees logged on to their government laptops to work on projects from the last administration, like generative AI for the IRS. One USDS worker said at the time that they did their best to ‚Äúignore the clown show.‚Äù Then Henderson received another email from DOGE: They wanted to speak with her again the following morning. She was told they liked her enthusiasm and wanted to draw her closer into the fray. Henderson did not return their admiration. From what she had seen of DOGE, she says, they showed a ‚Äúblatant lack of regard for the American people‚Äôs private data.‚Äù Henderson wanted no part of it. Instead of accepting the meeting, she forced-shut down her laptop and phone and didn't acknowledge the email until Monday, when she resigned. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be seen as being locked in with what DOGE was doing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOn the flip side, if I was to stand up to them, or to say no, Elon Musk has shown that he is totally OK blasting and doxing employees and having that army descend upon me.‚Äù She responded to the email saying she had found a new opportunity in the private sector. She hadn‚Äôt, but with her skills, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before she did. ‚ÄúI was put in a position where, whether I chose to engage or not engage, I might have to cross ethical lines. I would have to breach the oath to the Constitution that I swore. I would have to breach my morals,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was clear I was going to be asked to join in on one of their tirades and work on a complete dismantlement of government systems.‚Äù Later that month, DOGE imposed a $1 spending limit  on federal employee credit cards . The move instantly roiled agencies from the National Park Service to the National Institutes of Health as employees scrambled to buy basic necessities to do their jobs. Yet again, DOGE‚Äôs move-fast ethos would put Americans‚Äô personal data at risk. At one SSA office, a manager confirmed to his staff that he could no longer pay the company that shreds sensitive documents. ‚ÄúWe print a lot of shit daily,‚Äù one SSA employee told WIRED. ‚ÄúStuff with people‚Äôs names, addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, bank accounts, you name it. We have giant locking trash bins we put it in, and we pay a shredding company to empty them every month.‚Äù With the new $1 limit, the employee said, a ‚Äústockpile‚Äù of sensitive data was growing, leaving workers with two options: ‚ÄúShred it ourselves on regular office shredders‚Äîof which we have two, I think, and so it would take forever‚Äîor just sit on it while it piles up.‚Äù Other employees at SSA told WIRED that rather than showing their anger at work where they could face retribution, they instead attended weekend protests at Tesla dealerships in DC, part of a nationwide protest effort to drive down the share price of Musk‚Äôs electric car company. On March 7,  DOGE got one of the things it seemed to want most from GSA: a chatbot that could automate work previously done by federal employees. The tool rolled out to some 1,500 employees at GSA, with an agencywide launch planned a week later. An internal memo about the tool touted the ‚Äúendless‚Äù tasks it could help with: ‚Äúdraft emails, create talking points, summarize text, write code.‚Äù The memo hinted at the dangers of deploying chatbots at the federal level, warning workers not to ‚Äútype or paste‚Äù internal or personally identifiable information as inputs. People who used it weren‚Äôt impressed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about as good as an intern,‚Äù one GSA employee  told WIRED . ‚ÄúGeneric and guessable answers.‚Äù This version of GSAi almost certainly couldn‚Äôt interact with the EDS discovery layer first proposed by engineers. More likely it was just the first step in an iterative approach. As one official said in the February meeting about the project, the first goal could be to ‚Äúdeliver this sort of janky, doesn‚Äôt-work-all-the-time chatbot‚Äù to pave the way for a ‚Äúturbo-charged‚Äù version down the line. It‚Äôs unclear whether DOGE was on the same page. Around that time, GSA employees learned there were cuts on the way. ‚ÄúI encourage each of you to consider your options as we move forward,‚Äù wrote Stephen Ehikian, GSA‚Äôs acting administrator, whose wife had recently worked for Musk at X. ‚ÄúThe new GSA will be slimmer, more efficient, and laser-focused on efficiency and high-value outcomes.‚Äù Similar messages were going out across DC. The federal government‚Äôs funding was due to lapse on March 14, potentially triggering a shutdown. While Trump was busy lobbying House Republicans to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat until September,  WIRED reported  that Musk had expressed interest in a shutdown‚Äîin part because doing so would potentially make it easier to cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But hours before the House convened to vote on the resolution, Musk and Trump had apparently put their differences aside. They convened on the White House‚Äôs South Lawn to admire a small fleet of Teslas. Trump had recently posted that he planned to buy one. Of the protesters at Tesla factories who were speaking out against Musk‚Äôs work with DOGE, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to catch them‚Äù and that they would ‚Äúgo through hell.‚Äù The president and his richest ally walked around the cars, admiring the different colors, before getting into one. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs computer!‚Äù Trump exclaimed, after sitting down. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù It was Musk's car, but Trump occupied the driver‚Äôs seat.

The document, on which Politico  first reported , states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will ‚Äúleverage blockchain technology‚Äù as part of its procurement process. ‚ÄúAll distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,‚Äù the memo reads. ‚ÄúThis approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.‚Äù The memo does not make clear what specifically this means‚Äîif it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement. The memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the State Department  put the entire agency‚Äôs staff on administrative leave ,  slashed its workforce , and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world,  including those doing lifesaving work . Since then a  federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction  against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department. The plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard. Few blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve  large-scale use  in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there‚Äôs a reason for that‚Äîthe incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary. ‚ÄúIt feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn‚Äôt use existing tools.‚Äù Giulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no proven advantage that it‚Äôs cheaper or better,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe way it‚Äôs been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.‚Äù Got a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82. There have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  ran a small pilot  to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been  tested in Kenya  by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the  Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS) . One representative from an NGO that uses blockchain technology, but wasn‚Äôt authorized to speak to the media with regards to issues relating to USAID, says that particularly with regards to money transfers, stablecoins can be faster and easier than other methods of reaching communities impacted by a disaster. However, ‚Äúintroducing new systems means you‚Äôre setting up a new burden‚Äù for the many organizations that USAID partners with, they say. ‚ÄúThe relative cost of new systems is harder for small NGOs,‚Äù which would often include the kind of local organizations that would be at the front line of response to disasters. The proposed adoption of blockchain technology seems related to an emphasis on exerting tight controls over aid. The memo seems, for example, to propose that funding should be contingent on outcomes, reading, ‚ÄúTying payment to outcomes and results rather than inputs would ensure taxpayer dollars deliver maximum impact.‚Äù A USAID employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says that many of USAID‚Äôs contracts already function this way, with organizations being paid after performing their work. However, that‚Äôs not possible in all situations. ‚ÄúThose kinds of agreements are often not flexible enough for the environments we work in,‚Äù they say, noting that in conflict or disaster zones, situations can change quickly, meaning that what an organization may be able to do or need to do can fluctuate. Raftree says this language appears to be misleading, and bolsters claims made by Musk and the administration that USAID was corrupt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like USAID was delivering tons of cash to people who hadn‚Äôt done things,‚Äù she says.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-administration-usaid-blockchain/"},

What are you doing with my data?‚Äù  explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant‚Äôs algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC‚Äôs claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled  ‚Äú$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids‚Äô data: A game changer for COPPA compliance‚Äù  instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed  allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data  from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians. ‚ÄúIn terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,‚Äù a source familiar tells WIRED. Another removed FTC blog titled  ‚ÄúThe Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust‚Äù  outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act‚Äôs rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog  won an award in 2023  for ‚Äúexcellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.‚Äù The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk‚Äôs tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have  started to roll out AI products like GSAi , a general-purpose government chatbot. The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place ‚Äúwarning‚Äù labels above previous administrations‚Äô public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law. Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson‚Äôs criticisms center around the Republican party‚Äôs  long-standing allegations that social media platforms , like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards,  The New York Times reported in December . In an interview with CNBC last week , Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. ‚ÄúIf companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,‚Äù he said. Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs. ‚ÄúThey are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies‚Äô bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,‚Äù the source familiar alleges. ‚ÄúI think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/"},

Trump attended the dinner along with  Elon Musk , according to multiple photographs and videos of the event viewed by WIRED. Elon Musk, wearing his standard uniform of a black sport coat over a black T-shirt, was seen shaking hands and waving to other attendees. He was with a woman wearing a floor length gown who appeared to be Shivon Zilis, according to Instagram Reels posted by multiple guests. Zilis, a Neuralink executive who previously sat on the board of OpenAI, is the mother of four of Musk‚Äôs 14 known children. (Zilis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Musk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency has  spent the last six weeks  ransacking federal agencies, sat next to Trump at the dinner. WIRED previously reported  on another candlelight dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the  president‚Äôs public schedule  with a note reading ‚Äúthe President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.‚Äù The March 15 candlelight dinner did not appear on the official schedule. ‚ÄúYou are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest speaker President Donald J. Trump,‚Äù states the invitation, obtained by WIRED. ‚Äú$1,000,000 per person.‚Äù The invitation has a ‚ÄúMAGA INC.‚Äù header and a note at the bottom of the invitation reads, ‚ÄúDonald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a special guest speaker and is not asking for funds or donations.‚Äù MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump‚Äôs 2024 presidential campaign. WIRED has also reported  that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a ‚Äúhot ticket‚Äù in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the event or the lack of the event‚Äôs inclusion on the president‚Äôs official schedule. Got a Tip?

Experts WIRED has spoken with about these candlelight dinners have noted concerns about their unusual nature. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,‚Äù Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, previously told WIRED. ‚ÄúThe concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence. People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.‚Äù The candlelight dinner occurred over the same weekend as the Palm Event, an annual celebration of motorsports in Palm Beach, Florida. One of the celebration‚Äôs weekend events occurred at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday afternoon and featured ‚Äústreet sportscars and cars with a motorsports heritage, one-of-a-kind, concept cars, celebrity-owned and cars with a racing history,‚Äù according to the  Palm Event website . A number of these cars appeared the night prior at the candlelight dinner, according to Instagram reels that featured guests milling around a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Lamborghini, among other luxury vehicles displayed on the lawn. The evening also coincided with a serious escalation in Trump‚Äôs crackdown on immigration. On Saturday, while Trump and Musk dined with MAGA donors, a federal judge ordered the  White House  to stop the deportation of people the Trump administration alleged were Venezuelan gang members. Despite that ruling, two planes carrying the alleged gang members flew from Texas to El Salvador. Senior officials reportedly  told Axios  that the ruling held no force ‚Äúbecause the flights were over international waters.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-million-dollar-candlelight-dinner-elon-musk/"},

Last week, The New York Times  reported  that the White House is adding Musk-owned SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink Wi-Fi ‚Äúto improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex,‚Äù according to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House's Starlink internet service is reportedly being donated by the company. Spotty internet is an annoying but highly solvable problem that WIRED has  reported on   extensively . Of course, the White House is a highly complex organization operating out of a historic building, but network security researchers, government contractors, and former intelligence analysts with years of experience in US federal government security all tell WIRED that adding Starlink Wi-Fi in a seemingly rushed and haphazard way is an inefficient and counterproductive approach to solving connectivity issues. And they emphasized that it could set problematic precedents across the US government: that new pieces of technology can simply be layered into an environment at will without adequate oversight and monitoring. ‚ÄúThis is shadow IT, creating a network to bypass existing controls,‚Äù alleges Nicholas Weaver, a member of the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute's network security team and a computer science lecturer at UC Davis. He adds that while secret and top secret information is typically ( but not always ) processed only on special, separate federal networks that have no wireless access, the security and uniformity of White House Wi-Fi is still extremely important to national security. ‚ÄúA network like the White House unclassified side is still going to be very sensitive,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúJust like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,‚Äù White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tells WIRED in a statement. A White House source who asked not to be named supported the switch, arguing that in some areas of the campus, ‚Äúthe old Wi-Fi was trash.‚Äù Researchers point out that while Starlink is a robust commercial ISP like any other, it is not clear that it is being implemented in compliance with White House Communication Agency requirements. If the controls on the White House Starlink Wi-Fi are more lax than on other White House Wi-Fi, it could introduce security exposures and blind spots in network monitoring for anomalous activity. ‚ÄúThe only reason they'd need Starlink would be to bypass existing security controls that are in place from WHCA,‚Äù claims former NSA hacker Jake Williams. ‚ÄúThe biggest issues would be: First, if they don't have full monitoring of the Starlink connection. And second, if it allows remote management tools, so they could get remote access back into the White House networks. Obviously anyone could abuse that access.‚Äù One baffling aspect of the arrangement is that Starlink and other satellite internet is designed to be used in places that have little or no access to terrestrial internet service‚Äîin other words, places where there are no reliable fiber lines or no wired infrastructure at all. Instead of a traditional ISP modem, Starlink customers get special panels that they install on a roof or other outdoor place to receive connectivity from orbiting satellites. The New York Times reported, though, that the White House Starlink panels are actually installed miles away at a White House data center that is routing the connectivity over existing fiber lines. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED that this setup is bizarre. ‚ÄúIt is extra stupid to go satellite to fiber to actual site,‚Äù ICSI's Weaver says. ‚ÄúStarlink is inferior service anyplace where you have wire-line internet already available and, even in places which don't, inferior if you have reasonable line of sight to a cell tower.‚Äù Weaver and others note that Starlink is a robust product and isn't inherently unreliable just because it is delivered via satellite. But in a location where fiber lines are highly available and, ultimately, the service is being delivered via those lines anyway, the setup is deeply inefficient. While Starlink as a service is technically reliable, incorporating it in the White House could create a long-term federal dependence on an Elon Musk‚Äìcontrolled service, which could create future instabilities. After European officials raised concerns earlier this month on whether Starlink might stop serving Ukraine, Musk  posted  on social media: ‚ÄúTo be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals ‚Ä¶ We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.‚Äù Updated at 3 pm ET, March 24, 2025, to add comment from the White House, additional details from a White House source, and further context around the transmission of classified materials.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/white-house-starlink-wifi/"},

The date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate  attending a ‚Äúcandlelight‚Äù dinner  that wasn‚Äôt on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting  Houthi leadership . At least 53 people, including children,  were killed . Trump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk‚Äôs 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president‚Äôs brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing. The candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events. Details of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group.‚Äù (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story,  The Atlantic reported  on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials. The day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù According to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller‚Äîwho WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as  ‚ÄúPM,‚Äù short for prime minister ‚Äîeffectively shut down Vance‚Äôs concern. ‚ÄúAs I heard it, the president was clear: green light,‚Äù an account with Miller‚Äôs initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. ‚ÄúAmazing job,‚Äù wrote Waltz. ‚ÄúA good start,‚Äù wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by ‚ÄúMAR‚Äù in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely ‚ÄúMarco Antonio Rubio,‚Äù wrote ‚ÄúGood Job Pete and your team!!‚Äù referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: ‚ÄúThe team in MAL did a great job too,‚Äù referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trump‚Äôs team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago. About 45 minutes later, Trump confirmed the Yemen bombings. ‚ÄúToday, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,‚Äù he posted on  Truth Social . ‚ÄúThey have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones. ... To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON‚ÄôT, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!‚Äù John Bolton, Trump's fourth national security adviser from his first term, said on CNN that the entirety of the discussion about the military operation in Yemen ‚Äúshould've been discussed in the Situation Room,‚Äù either in a principals committee meeting or a full National Security Council one. ‚ÄúHow can you conduct official government business over a nonofficial channel?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWords fail me here. I cannot even imagine this happening.\" Got a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, Leak2Lahut.26, zoeschiffer.87, and timmarchman.01. The Department of Defense specifically  bars  Signal as a means of transmitting nonpublic DOD information unless previously authorized. Under  federal guidelines , security clearance and eligibility to hold a sensitive position can be revoked for negligent disclosure of protected information. In one  case , the government sought to deny clearance to a contractor in part because he left a laptop containing sensitive information‚Äîit turned out to be an unclassified aircraft maintenance record and an unclassified email‚Äîin the ‚Äúunsupervised custody of a Peruvian national.‚Äù Under the Espionage Act, unauthorized disclosure of national defense information can be punished by a fine or imprisonment. In 2017, reporters for Gizmodo and ProPublica  demonstrated  that Trump properties, including Mar-a-Lago, had weakly encrypted and open Wi-Fi networks, a misconfigured router and server, and other glaring security vulnerabilities. At the time, attackers could have taken control of devices connected to Trump networks, according to the publications. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for a comment from WIRED; in 2017 it told Gizmodo and ProPublica that it adhered to ‚Äúcybersecurity best practices.‚Äù In 2023, Trump‚Äôs lawyers asked a federal judge to petition the Justice Department to  ‚Äùre-establish‚Äù a secure facility  where sensitive matters could be discussed at Mar-a-Lago. Whether this has happened isn‚Äôt clear, but typically, an estate where the president spends a great deal of time would have a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, installed specifically so that the president and their advisers could discuss classified information securely, using government equipment. Personally owned electronic devices are  not allowed in SCIFs ; government- and contractor-owned ones are, but only under certain circumstances. The handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago became the subject of a federal investigation when the president was out of office: In early 2022, the National Archives alerted the Department of Justice that there were classified documents in 15 boxes that had been left at Mar-a-Lago, which triggered a property search six months later. Trump pleaded not guilty to 40 counts related to his handling of classified materials upon leaving office. A federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. WIRED previously reported on the dinner  on March 15 and another ‚Äúcandlelight‚Äù dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the  president‚Äôs public schedule  with a note reading, ‚ÄúThe President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.‚Äù The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about the dinner, security issues or federal guidelines involved with the Signal chat, and whether Waltz or any of the other chat participants will face disciplinary action. A senior administration official  told Politico  on Monday afternoon that ‚Äúthey are involved in multiple text threads with other administration staffers on what to do with Waltz.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs President Trump said, the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an email to WIRED, repeating her earlier statement from Monday afternoon on The Atlantic‚Äôs story.

Civil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk‚Äôs role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations. Bondi‚Äôs announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots ‚ÄúTesla Takedown‚Äù events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are  scheduled to take place  at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The  demonstrations  have multiplied since they began in  mid-February , with some attracting  hundreds of people  each. Most of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them  have   said  that they don‚Äôt endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in  Colorado  and  Boston . By labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism,  the FBI can file  broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets ‚Äúspecial authorities\" while investigating terrorism, including ‚Äúsingle-jurisdiction search warrants‚Äù from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a  2023 report  from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get ‚Äúconfidential education records‚Äù from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes. The FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from  more than 30  federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies,  including  the ‚ÄúDepartment of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,‚Äù as well as local police throughout a particular region. In addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as  social media surveillance  tools,  face recognition  programs, and allegedly ‚Äú stingrays ‚Äù that can intercept data from cell phones. Most of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However,  some lawyers  have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases. Privileged Access There aren‚Äôt explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems ‚Äúdomestic terrorism‚Äù incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. ‚ÄúIt would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,‚Äù German says. That could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that aren‚Äôt available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation. There‚Äôs precedent for companies not only receiving information from law enforcement during domestic terrorism investigations, but also working directly with the FBI. German says this was particularly evident during the response to a wave of oil pipeline protests in the early 2010s. Records published by  the news site Grist  and Type Investigations found that the FBI considered one pipeline operator a ‚Äúdomain stakeholder‚Äù in one protest case, which gave the company ‚Äúdirect access to the White House‚Äù and privileged information. The company  was also invited  to strategize with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, National Guard, and local police. And there were conversations about how to ‚Äúensure coordination and resource management‚Äù not only among law enforcement officials, but with the company. A different pipeline constructor hired a firm to  monitor and infiltrate  protest groups and write  intelligence reports , which were sometimes shared with federal law enforcement and local police, according to reporting by The Intercept. One of these pipeline operators briefed local police along its proposed pipeline route on how to  possibly pursue  criminal charges against organizers, Grist reported. Even after the protests waned, oil and gas companies remained close to police and the government. One Canadian pipeline company paid local Minnesotan police departments  more than $5 million  in 2020 and 2021 for policing pipeline protests. Since 2017, fossil fuel lobbyists  have pushed more than 20 states  to pass laws making disrupting ‚Äúcritical infrastructure‚Äù like oil and gas pipelines a criminal offense, according to records obtained by The Guardian. Though it‚Äôs unclear how the FBI‚Äôs current domestic terrorism investigations will play out, Musk and other Tesla executives could ultimately have similar access to and influence over them. When the cases go to court, Tesla could also be eligible for compensation from the government in the form of court-ordered restitution. Such funds are often used to pay the families of terrorism victims, but German tells WIRED that corporations are also eligible. In a successful criminal case, he says, he sees no reason why Tesla wouldn‚Äôt get compensated. Tesla could also be eligible for money from state-level terrorism victim compensation programs, which  receive some  funding from the federal government. Risks for Protesters Domestic terrorism investigations are often fraught. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have  argued that  the FBI routinely uses them to unfairly surveil activists and communities of color without adequate oversight. President Trump has said his administration is taking Tesla incidents very seriously. ‚ÄúPeople that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders,‚Äù Trump wrote in a  social media post  on Thursday. ‚ÄúWE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!‚Äù Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU‚Äôs national security project, says that instead of ‚Äúfocusing on the most serious criminal conduct that harms life,‚Äù federal agencies have wasted resources and abused their authority by ‚Äútreating alleged non-violent civil disobedience or vandalism as justification for abusive investigations of civil rights and other activists.‚Äù Historically, German says, the FBI has endorsed an idea called ‚Äúradicalization theory,‚Äù which posits that the beliefs of extremists naturally escalate from moderate and widely held beliefs. That logic, he says, justifies the FBI casting a wide surveillance net, particularly when it comes to monitoring activists. ‚ÄúThey suggest that anybody who's got a similar ideology might be willing to commit the same kind of crime,‚Äù German explains. ‚ÄúWe've seen a lot of abuse of FBI investigative authorities, particularly around domestic advocacy groups.‚Äù Five years ago, the FBI used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  to surveil people participating  in Black Lives Matter protests, investigating whether they had ties to terrorists. The  DOJ inspector general  called the incident an example of the FBI‚Äôs ‚Äúwidespread non-compliance‚Äù with FISA rules. German claims that in this case, instead of focusing on people who are alleged to have committed arson or acts of violence, the FBI‚Äôs focus could ultimately be scrutinizing people who it thinks are expressing ‚Äúanger or animosity towards Tesla or Elon Musk.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-tesla-arson-domestic-terrorism-protests/"},

As that name becomes a shorthand for the biggest public blunder of the second Trump administration to date, however, security and privacy experts who have promoted Signal as the best encrypted messaging tool available to the public want to be clear about one thing: SignalGate is not about Signal. Since The Atlantic‚Äôs editor, Jeffrey Goldberg,  revealed Monday  that he was mistakenly included in a Signal group chat earlier this month created to plan US airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the reaction from the Trump cabinet‚Äôs critics and even the administration itself has in some cases seemed to cast blame on Signal for the security breach. Some commentators have pointed to reports last month of  Signal-targeted phishing by Russian spies . National security adviser Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the Signal group chat, has even suggested that Goldberg may have  hacked  into it. On Wednesday afternoon, even President Donald Trump suggested Signal was somehow responsible for the group chat fiasco. ‚ÄúI don't know that Signal works,‚Äù Trump  told reporters  at the White House. ‚ÄúI think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you.‚Äù The real lesson is much simpler, says Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher who has conducted audits on widely used encryption tools in the past as the director of the Open Crypto Audit Project: Don‚Äôt invite untrusted contacts into your Signal group chat. And if you‚Äôre a government official working with highly sensitive or classified information, use the encrypted communication tools that run on restricted, often  air-gapped  devices intended for a top-secret setting rather than the unauthorized devices that can run publicly available apps like Signal. ‚ÄúUnequivocally, no blame in this falls on Signal,‚Äù says White. ‚ÄúSignal is a communication tool designed for confidential conversations. If someone's brought into a conversation who‚Äôs not meant to be part of it, that's not a technology problem. That's an operator issue.‚Äù Cryptographer Matt Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more simply. ‚ÄúSignal is a tool. If you misuse a tool, bad things are going to happen,‚Äù says Green. ‚ÄúIf you hit yourself in the face with a hammer, it‚Äôs not the hammer‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs really on you to make sure you know who you‚Äôre talking to.‚Äù The only sense in which SignalGate  is  a Signal-related scandal, White adds, is that the use of Signal suggests that the cabinet-level officials involved in the Houthi bombing plans, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, were conducting the conversation on internet-connected devices‚Äîpossibly even including personal ones‚Äîsince Signal wouldn‚Äôt typically be allowed on the official, highly restricted machines intended for such conversations. ‚ÄúIn past administrations, at least, that would be absolutely forbidden, especially for classified communications,‚Äù says White. Indeed, using Signal on internet-connected commercial devices doesn‚Äôt just leave communications open to anyone who can somehow exploit a hackable vulnerability in Signal, but anyone who can hack the iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac devices that might be running the Signal mobile or desktop apps. This is why US agencies in general, and the Department of Defense in particular, conduct business on specially managed federal devices that are specially provisioned to control what software is installed and which features are available. Whether the cabinet members had conducted the discussion on Signal or another consumer platform, the core issue was communicating about incredibly high-stakes, secret military operations using inappropriate devices or software. One of the most straightforward reasons that communication apps like Signal and WhatsApp are not suitable for classified government work is that they offer ‚Äúdisappearing message‚Äù features‚Äîmechanisms to automatically delete messages after a preset amount of time‚Äîthat are incompatible with federal record retention laws. This issue was on full display in the principals‚Äô chat about the impending strike on Yemen, which was originally set for one-week auto-delete before the Michael Waltz account changed the timer to four-week auto-delete, according to  screenshots of the chat  published by The Atlantic on Wednesday. Had The Atlantic‚Äôs Goldberg not been mistakenly included in the chat, its contents might not have been preserved in accordance with long-standing government requirements. In congressional testimony on Wednesday, US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard  said  that Signal can come preinstalled on government devices. Multiple sources tell WIRED that this is not the norm, though, and noted specifically that downloading consumer apps like Signal to Defense Department devices is highly restricted and often banned. The fact that Hegseth, the defense secretary, participated in the chat indicates that he either obtained an extremely unusual waiver to install Signal on a department device, bypassed the standard process for seeking such a waiver, or was using a non-DOD device for the chat. According to  political consultant and podcaster Fred Wellman , DOD ‚Äúpolitical appointees‚Äù demanded that Signal be installed on their government devices last month. Core to the Trump administration‚Äôs defense of the behavior is the claim that no classified material was discussed in the Signal chat. In particular, Gabbard and others have noted that Hegseth himself is the classification authority for the information. Multiple sources tell WIRED, though, that this authority does not make a consumer application the right forum for such a discussion. ‚ÄúThe way this was being communicated, the conversation had no formal designation like 'for official use only' or something. But whether it should have been classified or not, whatever it was, it was obviously sensitive operational information that no soldier or officer would be expected to release to the public‚Äîbut they had added a member of the media into the chat,‚Äù says Andy Jabbour, a US Army veteran and founder of the domestic security risk-management firm Gate 15. Jabbour adds that military personnel undergo annual information awareness and security training to reinforce operating procedures for handling all levels of nonpublic information. Multiple sources emphasize to WIRED that while the information in the Yemen strike chat appears to meet the standard for classification, even nonclassified material can be extremely sensitive and is typically carefully protected. ‚ÄúPutting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it‚Äôs also just mind-boggling to me that all of these senior folks who were on this line and nobody bothered to even check, security hygiene 101, who are all the names? Who are they?‚Äù US senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said during Tuesday‚Äôs Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. According to The Atlantic, 12 Trump administration officials were in the Signal group chat, including vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Trump adviser Susie Wiles. Jabbour adds that even with ‚Äã‚Äãdecisionmaking authorities present and participating in a communication, establishing an information designation or declassifying information happens through an established, proactive process. As he puts it, ‚ÄúIf you spill milk on the floor, you can‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs actually not spilled milk, because I intended to spill it.‚Äô‚Äù All of which is to say, SignalGate raises plenty of security, privacy, and legal issues. But the security of Signal itself is not one of them. Despite that, in the wake of The Atlantic‚Äôs story on Monday, some have sought tenuous connections between the Trump cabinet‚Äôs security breach and Signal vulnerabilities. On Tuesday, for example, a Pentagon adviser echoed a report from Google‚Äôs security researchers, who  alerted Signal  earlier this year to a phishing technique that Russian military intelligence used to target the app‚Äôs users in Ukraine. But Signal pushed out an update to make that tactic‚Äîwhich tricks users into adding a hacker as a secondary device on their account‚Äîfar harder to pull off, and the same tactic also targeted some accounts on the messaging services WhatsApp and Telegram. ‚ÄúPhishing attacks against people using popular applications and websites are a fact of life on the internet,‚Äù Signal spokesperson Jun Harada tells WIRED. ‚ÄúOnce we learned that Signal users were being targeted, and how they were being targeted, we introduced additional safeguards and in-app warnings to help protect people from falling victim to phishing attacks. This work was completed months ago.\" In fact, says White, the cryptography researcher, if the Trump administration is going to put secret communications at risk by discussing war plans on unapproved commercial devices and freely available messaging apps, they could have done much worse than to choose Signal for those conversations, given its reputation and track record among security experts. ‚ÄúSignal is the consensus recommendation for highly at-risk communities‚Äîhuman rights activists, attorneys, and confidential sources for journalists,‚Äù says White. Just not, as this week has made clear, executive branch officials planning airstrikes.

The administration later said that ‚Äúlifesaving‚Äù work was  exempt  and could continue. But USAID employees and officials from nonprofit organizations say they are still being blocked from doing vital work on ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. The consequences may be dire: ‚ÄúAt a minimum, 300 babies that wouldn‚Äôt have had HIV, now do,‚Äù one current USAID worker estimates. WIRED interviewed eight current and former USAID employees and contractors for this story, several of whom directly work on the agency‚Äôs HIV and AIDS programs. They were granted anonymity due to fears of retaliation and because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency. USAID did not respond to requests for comment. Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service has plowed through several government agencies since President Donald Trump took office last month, proposing  sweeping changes  to federal infrastructure. But no agency has been gutted as thoroughly as USAID. A cadre of  young DOGE agents  have been stationed in USAID‚Äôs headquarters since last week; after reportedly  wresting control  of USAID‚Äôs secure systems and placing key personnel on administrative leave, the DOGE team began cutting off staff email accounts on a rolling, seemingly random basis, with no guidance or explanation, employees claim. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been absolutely hellish,‚Äù says a current USAID employee who lost access to their email on Monday morning. ‚ÄúWe spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,‚Äù Musk  said on social media  Sunday. ‚ÄúCould [sic] gone to some great parties. Did that instead.‚Äù One popular program implemented by USAID, however, has already been granted an ‚Äúemergency humanitarian waiver‚Äù to keep operating: the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The global health program, which was founded by former US president George W. Bush and is overseen by the State Department, has saved an  estimated 26 million lives  since its launch in 2003. It‚Äôs implemented by a handful of government agencies, including USAID. While in theory the Trump administration‚Äôs waiver allows the program to resume some of its activities while the foreign aid freeze is still in effect, in reality, sources tell WIRED that much of its lifesaving work remains paused. \"Your money is being unfrozen but you can‚Äôt contact the people who actually froze it,\" a senior official at an HIV/AIDS organization told WIRED. \"There‚Äôs a bigger communication blockage that is frustrating even the efforts put in place to free up the lifesaving work.\" Large numbers of USAID employees have been  placed on administrative  leave or locked out of their emails and work servers in recent days, including those working on a variety of what they say are critical public health missions. USAID staffers say this demonstrates that the emergency waiver application process is ineffective and isn‚Äôt ensuring that aid workers can continue serving vulnerable populations. USAID staff who still have access to their email accounts received a notice on Monday evening from Ken Jackson, the agency‚Äôs assistant to the administrator for management and resources, saying that the agency ‚Äúwould likely undergo a reorganization‚Äù and be integrated into the State Department. ‚ÄúAs we evaluate USAID and ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda, the President Trump Administration, and the efforts of the State Department, we will focus on ensuring every agency dollar is delivering targeted and results-driven aid,‚Äù the email read. In countries like Zambia, Nigeria, Haiti, and Mozambique, medical equipment ranging from antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV to pre-exposure prophylaxis and condoms that can prevent transmission of the disease are currently sitting in limbo, according to the same USAID worker who warned of a drastic uptick in the number of children living with HIV. The aid is unable to reach its destinations because the USAID workers tasked with logistics have been placed on administrative leave. ‚ÄúWhen a baby is born, you do an early infant diagnostic test, and if it comes back positive, you can blitz them with retrovirals, but you can‚Äôt do that if you don‚Äôt have retrovirals,‚Äù the same USAID worker says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an absolute disaster.‚Äù In Haiti, an aid worker confirmed that HIV/AIDS medication from USAID remains inaccessible. ‚ÄúWe cannot touch the medication,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúEverything is on hold.‚Äù The worker added that nobody from USAID had answered their phone calls for days. ‚ÄúThe Trump administration is playing with tens of millions of people's lives, and Haiti is just one consequential example of that in our hemisphere,‚Äù says Asia Russell, the executive director of the international HIV advocacy group Health GAP.

While PEPFAR is the most well-known HIV/AIDS program implemented by USAID, the agency has a number of additional projects devoted to the issue. One current USAID worker whose research focuses on prophylactic devices primarily for women in sub-Saharan Africa says that their work has been interrupted, too. They say members of their team were abruptly cut off from their work emails this afternoon. ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt yet applied for a humanitarian waiver,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even have a way of contacting IT.‚Äù Democratic lawmakers and dozens of USAID employees protested in front of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, DC, on Monday after they were denied access to USAID‚Äôs offices. ‚ÄúThis illegal, unconstitutional interference with congressional power is threatening lives all over the world,‚Äù  said  Maryland representative Jamie Raskin. A current USAID employee shared an email with WIRED they received from the agency on Monday night, informing them that USAID buildings in Washington will remain closed tomorrow. ‚ÄúWe will continue to provide further updates as they become available,‚Äù the email reads. ‚ÄúThank you for your cooperation.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/usaid-researchers-email-access/"},

Court documents in  Alliance for Retired Americans et al v. Bessent et al  and  American Federation of Teachers et al v. Bessent et al  reveal the extent of DOGE‚Äôs penetration into the most sensitive systems at the Treasury, including the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), and what exactly DOGE was hoping to accomplish. The bureau is nested within the US Treasury and handles most federal payments, to the tune of more than $5 trillion a year. WIRED first reported that Marko Elez, a former engineer at X, the social media company owned by Musk,  had read/write access  to two BFS systems: the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS). But documents now reveal that Elez also had ‚Äúread‚Äù access to Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), an accounting system where federal funds are stored in pre-authorized accounts. Court documents shared by the government reveal Elez had access as of February 1. From court filings, it appears this access was in service of the administration‚Äôs plans to target USAID. USAID was one of the  earliest targets  of DOGE and the Trump administration. Less than two weeks after Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the majority of the agency‚Äôs staff were  placed on administrative leave , and funding to many partner organizations  was cut off . The documents appear to show how plans were in place for this sudden strangulation in payments to happen. In a January 26 email between Matthew Garber, a top Treasury official, and the Treasury secretary‚Äôs chief of staff, Garber outlined the new administration‚Äôs plan to utilize BFS access to halt payments to USAID. ‚ÄúFiscal will intercept USAID payments files prior to ingestion into our PAM/SPS systems (this is in place now and can begin immediately),‚Äù Garber wrote. ‚ÄúWe developed a process to intercept the file, and additional flags to ensure we catch all USAID payment requests through our systems.‚Äù (This email chain was included as part of documents shared in the  Alliance for Retired Americans  lawsuit.) ‚ÄúFiscal will manually pull an unredacted and unmodified copy to share with State officials,‚Äù Garber continued, outlining plans from his team. \"State officials will review and provide a determination to Fiscal on whether or not to release the file into our normal payment processes.‚Äù A top  Treasury official‚Äôs calendar  shows that a few days later, Elez arrived in Kansas City, one of the main BFS sites, and had a full docket of meet and greets and several deep dives with the teams responsible for each of the systems. The plan was for Elez to spend the next month at the facility to identify ‚Äúopportunities to advance payment integrity and fraud reduction goals.‚Äù According to a planning sheet, which was also shared with the court, ‚Äúonly (1) individual (i.e. the designated technical team member)‚Äù‚Äîwhich was Elez‚Äî‚Äúrequires access to Fiscal Service systems and data at this time.‚Äù Records show that in the final days of January, a request was placed to grant Elez access to both systems. On January 31, David Lebryk, who had been acting Treasury secretary and at one point was the commissioner of BFS,  abruptly announced he would retire  after he had been placed on administrative leave for refusing to provide DOGE with access to these payment systems. For those who knew the Treasury intimately,  this set off alarm bells . That same day, according to an attachment provided by the government, at 6:07 pm, a ticket was filed disregarding a previous order just a day before to give Elez just read-only access: ‚Äúsorry read/write is needed.‚Äù At the same time  Lebryk stepped away , DOGE gained access to the entirety of USAID‚Äôs IT systems and network,  according to reporting from ProPublica . The next day, as the dismantling of USAID was underway, according to court documents, Elez was granted access to the source codes of ASAP, SPS, and PAM. He was also granted read-only access to the production database for the SPS and PAM. People with knowledge of Treasury systems tell WIRED that it would be uncommon, if not ‚Äúunheard of,‚Äù for a BFS employee to have access to all these systems simultaneously. ‚ÄúWithin Fiscal, the mainframe guys don‚Äôt have write access to the databases and vice versa,‚Äù says a former BFS employee who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. Normally, they say, employees at BFS are given the minimum amount of access to systems required to do their jobs. ‚ÄúNo BFS employee would normally have this kind of access.‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82 and MattGiles45.42. According to an affidavit from another top Treasury official, though, that plan to isolate USAID payment files outlined by Garber was temporarily paused for the next several days‚Äîthe State Department had decided it would instead intercept the files. However, on February 4 and February 5, USAID payments flowed to the PAM portal designed by Garber‚Äôs team. That same affidavit outlined the next steps: BFS was instructed to focus on flagging, quarantining, and sending several payments to State officials that fell under President Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign aid  executive order  that stated there would be a 90-day pause on this aid as the State Department reviewed each program. This plan, according to an email chain included in one of the lawsuits, was vetted by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who was ‚Äúcomfortable proceeding.‚Äù These payments, which originated from the Department of Health and Human Services, included funding for ‚ÄúRefugee and Entrant Assistance,‚Äù ‚ÄúGifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRefugee Resettlement Assistance.‚Äù By then, Musk had doubled down on his contempt for USAID: In a  February 2 post on X , Musk wrote, ‚ÄúUSAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.‚Äù DOGE operatives, including Luke Farritor, a  young member , had gained ‚Äúsuper administrator‚Äù access to USAID‚Äôs systems,  according to ProPublica . Farritor, who had also been at the  Department of Health and Human Services  as well as the General Services Administration (GSA), was reportedly going through USAID‚Äôs payment system manually, shutting off agency funding,  according to The Washington Post . Elez was in the midst of a similar operation in Kansas City: According to that Treasury official‚Äôs affidavit, the engineer began to manually identify and review the foreign aid payment files that had been sequestered in the folder Garber outlined in that late January email. Meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to give Elez even further access. A February 3 IT ticket, included in case documents from the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit, reveals that requests were made for Elez to access the  Central Accounting Reporting System , ‚Äúthe electronic system of record for the government‚Äôs financial data.‚Äù That same day, a motion filed by the plaintiffs in  another lawsuit  alleges Elez copied and downloaded a pair of USAID files from the PAM database to his laptop; around that same time, an affidavit from the Bureau of Fiscal Service‚Äôs chief security officer said Elez emailed a spreadsheet with personally identifiable information to two GSA officials  via unencrypted channels . (Both of these actions are at the core of one of the lawsuits against Bessent and the Treasury Department; the plaintiffs in that suit were recently granted expedited discovery to access records related to Elez‚Äôs tenure at BFS.) A DOGE team had  already established a presence at the GSA , which  included Farritor , as well as former Tesla employee Thomas Shedd and other DOGE members Ethan Shaotran and  Edward Coristine . After WIRED reported on February 4 that Elez had unprecedented access to the Treasury‚Äôs payments systems, Bessent  asserted in a letter to Congress  that Tom Krause, then a special government employee associated with DOGE at the Treasury, only had ‚Äúread‚Äù access. Elez was not mentioned in that letter. In her memo granting a preliminary injunction in the  American Federation of Teachers  lawsuit, filed on March 24, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote, ‚Äúaccording to a spreadsheet attached to a February 3, 2025 email from a Treasury executive point person for the engagement, as of February 1, Elez had access to Treasury systems including PAM, SPS, and ASAP, and it was recommended that his access to other Treasury systems be expanded.‚Äù On February 5, while Elez had access to Treasury‚Äôs most sensitive systems, he received an email from the deputy assistant commissioner for enterprise IT operations noting that, though he had been issued a BFS laptop, he had yet to sign the bureau‚Äôs ‚Äúrules of behavior.‚Äù (This email was included among documents shared by the government in one of the lawsuits.) Those rules include, following ‚Äúlaws, regulations, and policies governing the use and entrance to such facilities,‚Äù and protecting any ‚ÄúFiscal Service data, equipment and IT systems from loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized use or disclosure.‚Äù Elez, it would appear, had already violated these rules by sharing the data with the GSA officials. The next day, Elez resigned after the  The Wall Street Journal  sought comment for a report about racist posts on social media accounts that appeared to belong to him. Elez is now one of the many DOGE operatives working at the  Social Security Administration . In late February, USAID said it would  cancel 90 percent  of the agency‚Äôs contracts. The contract cancellations threw nonprofits around the world into  chaos  and slowed the response to  infectious diseases . Earlier this month, a federal judge said the  dismantling of USAID  ‚Äúlikely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.‚Äù The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This week, Trump signed an  executive order  stating that all federal payments should be consolidated within the Treasury. The order claims that doing so will help fight fraud, waste, and abuse. Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, believes the order means that, ‚Äúinstead of having to send some DOGE guy into an agency to control the payments, it all happens in one place. It moves power away from agencies and centralizes it in the White House.‚Äù In his order, Trump claimed that $1.5 trillion passes through other avenues, known as non-Treasury disbursing offices. These are nested within certain agencies that are able to disburse funds without going through the BFS system. Moynihan alleges that the strangulation of USAID‚Äôs funding could be a ‚Äúharbinger‚Äù of potential changes at other agencies. The administration appears particularly focused, he says, on ‚Äúthe president having absolute power and control over where money goes regardless of laws on impoundment or statutes on agencies.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a consolidation of power in the name of efficiency,‚Äù he claims.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-plan-treasury-usaid/"},

The auditorium was packed, with hundreds of employees attending the meeting in person and thousands more tuning in online. While the tone of the live event remained polite, the chat that accompanied the live stream was a different story. ‚Äú‚ÄòMy door is always open‚Äô but we‚Äôve been told we can‚Äôt go to the floor you work on?‚Äù wrote one employee, according to Google Meet chat logs for the event obtained by WIRED. Employees used their real names to ask questions, but WIRED has chosen not to include those names to protect the privacy of the staffers. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want an AI demo, we want answers to what is going on with [reductions in force],‚Äù wrote another, as over 100 GSA staffers added a ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù emoji to the post. But an AI demo is what they got. During the meeting, Ehikian and other high-ranking members of the GSA team showed off  GSAi , a chatbot tool built by employees at the  Technology Transformation Services . In its current form, the bot is meant to help employees with mundane tasks like writing emails. But Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been pushing for a  more complex version  that could eventually tap into government databases. Roughly  1,500 people  have access to GSAi today, and by tomorrow, the bot will be deployed to more than 13,000 GSA employees, WIRED has learned. Musk associates‚Äîincluding Ehikian and  Thomas  Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who now runs the Technology Transformation Services within GSA‚Äîhave put AI at the heart of their agenda. Yesterday, GSA hosted a media roundtable to show its AI tool to reporters. ‚ÄúAll information shared during this event is on deep background‚Äîattributable to a ‚ÄòGSA official familiar with the development of the AI tool,‚Äô‚Äù an invite read. (Reporters from Bloomberg, The Atlantic, and Fox were invited. WIRED was not.) GSA was one of the first federal agencies Musk‚Äôs allies took over in late January,  WIRED reported . Ehikian, who is married to a former employee of Elon Musk‚Äôs X, works alongside Shedd and Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk‚Äôs transition team at the company. Hollander is partners with Steve Davis, who has taken a leading role at DOGE. More than 1,835 GSA employees have taken a deferred resignation offer since the leadership change, as  DOGE continues its push  to reportedly ‚Äúright-size‚Äù the federal workforce. Employees who remain have been told to return to the office five days a week. Their credit cards‚Äîused for everything from paying for software tools to buying equipment for work‚Äîhave a  spending limit of $1 . Employees at the all-hands meeting‚Äîanxious to hear about whether more people will lose their jobs and why they‚Äôve lost access to critical software tools‚Äîwere not pleased. \"We are very busy after losing people and this is not [an] efficient use of time,‚Äù one employee wrote. ‚ÄúLiterally who cares about this,‚Äù wrote another. ‚ÄúWhen there are great tools out there, GSA‚Äôs job is to procure them, not make mediocre replacements,‚Äù a colleague added. ‚ÄúDid you use this AI to organize the [reduction in force]?‚Äù asked another federal worker. ‚ÄúWhen will the Adobe Pro be given back to us?‚Äù said another. ‚ÄúThis is a critical program that we use daily. Please give this back or at least a date it will be back.‚Äù Employees also pushed back against the return-to-office mandate. ‚ÄúHow does [return to office] increase collaboration when none of our clients, contractors, or people on our [integrated product teams] are going to be in the same office?‚Äù a GSA worker asked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll still be conducting all work over email or Google meetings.‚Äù One employee asked Ehikian who the DOGE team at GSA actually is. ‚ÄúThere is no DOGE team at GSA,‚Äù Ehikian responded, according to two employees with direct knowledge of the events. Employees, many of whom have seen DOGE staff at GSA, didn‚Äôt buy it. ‚ÄúLike we didn‚Äôt notice a bunch of young kids working behind a secure area on the 6th floor,‚Äù one employee told WIRED. Luke Farritor, a young  former SpaceX intern  who has worked at DOGE since the organization‚Äôs earliest days, was seen wearing sunglasses inside the GSA office in recent weeks, as was  Ethan Shaotran , another young DOGE worker who recently served as president of the Harvard mountaineering club. A GSA employee described Shaotran as ‚Äúgrinning in a blazer and T-shirt.‚Äù GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by WIRED. Got a Tip?

During the meeting, Ehikian showed off a slide detailing GSA‚Äôs goals‚Äîright-sizing, streamline operations, deregulation, and IT innovation‚Äîalongside current cost-savings. ‚ÄúOverall costs avoided‚Äù were listed at $1.84 billion. The number of employees using generative AI tools built by GSA was listed at 1,383. The number of hours saved from automations was said to be 178,352. Ehikian also pointed out that the agency has canceled or reduced 35,354 credit cards used by government workers and terminated  683 leases . (WIRED cannot confirm any of these statistics. DOGE has been known to share  misleading and inaccurate statistics  regarding its cost saving efforts.) ‚ÄúAny efficiency calculation needs a denominator,‚Äù a GSA employee wrote in the chat. ‚ÄúCuts can reduce expenses, but they can also reduce the value delivered to the American public. How is that captured in the scorecard?‚Äù In a slide titled ‚ÄúThe Road Ahead,‚Äù Ehikian laid out his vision for the future. ‚ÄúOptmize federal real estate portfolio,‚Äù read one pillar. ‚ÄúCentralize procurement,‚Äù read another. Sub categories included ‚Äúreduce compliance burden to increase competition,‚Äù ‚Äúcentralize our data to be accessible across teams,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOptimize GSA‚Äôs cloud and software spending.‚Äù Online, employees seemed leery. ‚ÄúSo, is Stephen going to restrict himself from working on any federal contracts after his term as GSA administrator, especially with regard to AI and IT software?‚Äù asked one employee in the chat.

His particular focus, sources say, was an increased role for AI not just at GSA, but at agencies government-wide. In what he described as an ‚ÄúAI-first strategy,‚Äù sources say, Shedd provided a handful of examples of projects GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian is looking to prioritize, including the development of ‚ÄúAI coding agents‚Äù that would be made available for all agencies. Shedd made it clear that he believes much of the work at TTS and the broader government, particularly around finance tasks, could be automated. \"This does raise red flags,‚Äù a cybersecurity expert who was granted anonymity due to concerns of retaliation told WIRED on Monday, who noted that automating the government isn‚Äôt the same as automating other things, like self-driving cars. ‚ÄúPeople, especially people who aren‚Äôt experts in the subject domain, coming into projects often think ‚Äòthis is dumb‚Äô and then find out how hard the thing really is.‚Äù Shedd instructed employees to think of TTS as a software startup that had become financially unstable. He suggested that the federal government needs a centralized data repository, and that he was actively working with others on a strategy to create one, although it wasn‚Äôt clear where this repository would be based or if these projects would comply with privacy laws. Shedd referred to these concerns as a ‚Äúroadblock‚Äù and said that the agency should still push forward to see what was possible. Got a Tip?

Sources say that during the call Shedd tightly connected TTS and the United States Digital Services‚Äîrebranded as the United States DOGE Service, or DOGE, under Trump‚Äîas ‚Äúpillars‚Äù of a new technological strategy. Later in the meeting, he said that there was no plan to merge the two groups and that projects would flow through them both depending on available staff and expertise, but continued emphasizing the upcoming collaboration between TTS and DOGE. Employees, sources say, also asked questions about the young engineers, who had previously not been identifying themselves in meetings. Shedd said that one of them felt comfortable enough to introduce himself in meetings on Monday, sources say, though Shedd added that he was nervous about their names being publicly revealed and their lives upended. Shedd was unable to answer many staff questions about the deferred resignations, the return to office mandate, or if the agency‚Äôs staff would face substantial cuts, according to sources. At one point, Shedd indicated that workforce cuts were likely for TTS, but declined to give more details. (Similar questions were also asked of Department of Government Efficiency leadership  in a Friday meeting first reported by WIRED .) Towards the end of the call, sources say, a TTS worker asked if they would be expected to work more than 40 hours per week, to deal with all of the upcoming work and potentially laid-off workers. Shedd responded that it was ‚Äúunclear.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lieutenant-gsa-ai-agency/"},

Two of those sources say that Elez‚Äôs privileges include the ability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). Housed on a secure mainframe, these systems control, on a granular level, government payments that in their totality amount to more than a fifth of the US economy. Despite  reporting that suggests  that Musk‚Äôs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force has access to these Treasury systems on a ‚Äúread-only‚Äù level, sources say Elez, who has visited a Kansas City office housing BFS systems, has many administrator-level privileges. Typically, those admin privileges could give someone the power to log in to servers through secure shell access, navigate the entire file system, change user permissions, and delete or modify critical files. That could allow someone to bypass the security measures of, and potentially cause irreversible changes to, the very systems they have access to. ‚ÄúYou could do anything with these privileges,‚Äù says one source with knowledge of the system, who adds that they cannot conceive of a reason that anyone would need them for purposes of simply hunting down fraudulent payments or analyzing disbursement flow. \"Technically I don't see why this couldn't happen,\" a federal IT worker tells WIRED in a phone call late on Monday night, referring to the possibility of a  DOGE  employee being granted elevated access to a government server. \"If you would have asked me a week ago, I'd have told you that this kind of thing would never in a million years happen. But now, who the fuck knows.\" A source says they are concerned that data could be passed from secure systems to DOGE operatives within the General Services Administration.  WIRED reporting  has shown that Elon Musk‚Äôs associates‚Äîincluding Nicole Hollander, who  slept in Twitter‚Äôs offices  as Musk acquired the company, and Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who  now runs a GSA agency , along with a host of  extremely young and inexperienced engineers ‚Äîhave infiltrated the GSA and have attempted to use White House security credentials to gain access to GSA tech, something experts have said is highly unusual and poses a huge security risk. Elez, according to public databases and other records reviewed by WIRED, is a 25-year-old who graduated Rutgers University in 2021 and subsequently worked at SpaceX, Musk‚Äôs space company, where he focused on vehicle telemetry, starship software, and satellite software. Elez then joined X, Musk‚Äôs social media company, where he worked on search AI. Public Github repositories show years of software development, with a particular interest in distributed systems, recommendation engines, and machine learning. He does not appear to have prior government experience. Elez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Broadly speaking, the US government pays out money in one of two ways. Agencies like the Department of Defense and the US Postal Service are legally authorized to originate, certify, and issue payments on their own. The vast majority of payments, though‚Äîincluding federal tax returns, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and veteran‚Äôs pay‚Äîflow through the Federal Disbursement Services, which according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a nonpartisan body, is charged with directing this money appropriately, moving it from government accounts to recipients. The Payment Automation Manager and the Secure Payment System are the mechanisms through which the money is paid out. Control of those mechanisms could allow someone to choke off money to specific federal agencies or even individuals, a fear that Democrats have expressed about DOGE. On Monday,  Senate Democrats warned  of DOGE‚Äôs encroachment into the payment system. ‚ÄúWill DOGE cut funding to programs approved by Congress that Donald Trump decides he doesn‚Äôt like,‚Äù said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. ‚ÄúWhat about cancer research? Food banks? School lunches? Veterans aid? Literacy programs? Small business loans?‚Äù The fight over whether DOGE could access Treasury systems led to a  previously reported  standoff between acting Treasury secretary David Lebryk and Musk‚Äôs associates. Lebryk was placed on administrative leave last week and subsequently resigned. ‚ÄúLebryk‚Äôs resignation set an example,‚Äù a source tells WIRED. ‚ÄúAny idea of resistance or noncompliance seems to be fading in the wake of that, and everything I have heard from leadership suggests they intend to give the ‚ÄòDOGE‚Äô operatives what they are asking for.‚Äù Updated, 2/4/2025, 11:45 AM EDT: WIRED has updated the article to clarify on which mainframe the systems are housed.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/"},

Minutes  after the tariffs  went into effect, China‚Äôs State Administration for Market Regulation said it was probing the American tech giant for potentially violating the country‚Äôs anti-monopoly law. The Chinese government may have strategically chosen to go after Google because it has limited operations in the country, ensuring the hit to the US tech giant would be relatively minimal. The move gives China plenty of room to escalate if the Trump administration announces further tariffs or other trade measures. Google declined to comment. China also announced it was putting more restrictions on the sale of some critical minerals like tungsten and slapping additional tariffs on farm equipment, pickup trucks, liquified natural gas, coal, and other goods from the US. While the US isn‚Äôt reliant on China for all of the impacted minerals, the country does control the majority of the world‚Äôs tungsten supply, which is used in light bulbs, semiconductors, and ammunition. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs position is firm and consistent. Trade and tariff wars have no winners,‚Äù China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a  statement  Sunday shortly after the tariffs were announced. ‚ÄúThis move cannot solve the US‚Äôs problems at home and, more importantly, does not benefit either side, still less the world.‚Äù China has kept Google in its crosshairs during the ongoing trade war with the US over the last few years. In 2020, the government reportedly  considered opening  an antitrust investigation into Google's Android business, according to Reuters. The deliberations followed a complaint from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which was targeted by Trump during his first term. Because of US sanctions, Huawei is unable to use American-made software like Google Mobile Services, a suite of tools widely used across the smartphone industry. The restrictions forced the company to develop  its own operating system  called Harmony OS. But most smartphones  around the world still run  on Android, which has sparked competition investigations in a number of countries, some of which have led to  concessionary changes  designed to give consumers and app developers more choices and lower fees. In China, several  smartphone makers  continue to rely on an open source version of Android. This past December, Chinese authorities also opened an anti-monopoly investigation into Nvidia, the chipmaker whose GPUs play a crucial role in the development of generative AI and have become a  significant source  of trade sparring between the US and China. The announcement came soon after the Biden administration  further tightened  China‚Äôs access to high-end semiconductors. About 15 years ago, Google  stopped offering  a search experience tailored for China following a series of Chinese government-linked  cyberattacks  against it and other US companies. Google  debated  reentering China with a search engine about  seven years ago , but the project  was scuttled  following protests from some employees concerned about supporting Chinese surveillance and censorship. Google has also stopped short of directly selling  cloud technologies in China , as local laws could threaten the privacy and security assurances it offers to customers in other markets. Other Google services  such as YouTube  are blocked by Chinese internet regulators. China has allowed domestic companies to buy advertisements through Google so that they can market to customers abroad. But the revenue from those deals is relatively small, and China didn't even garner a mention in parent company Alphabet's  annual financial report  last year. That stands in contrast to Meta,  which lists  China among its biggest markets in terms of advertiser location and said last year that China-based advertisers  account for 10 percent of its annual revenue .", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/google-china-antitrust-trump-tariffs/"},

An attorney representing two federal workers‚ÄîJane Does 1 and 2‚Äîfiled a motion this morning arguing that the server‚Äôs continued operation not only violates federal law but is potentially exposing vast quantities of government staffers‚Äô personal information to hostile foreign adversaries through unencrypted email. A  copy of the motion , filed in the DC District Court by National Security Counselors, a Washington-area public-interest law firm, was obtained by WIRED exclusively in advance. WIRED previously reported that Musk had  installed several lackeys  in OPM‚Äôs top offices, including individuals with ties to xAI, Neuralink, and other companies he owns. The initial lawsuit,  filed on January 27 , cites reports that Musk‚Äôs associates illegally connected a server to a government network for the purposes of harvesting information, including the names and email accounts of federal employees. The server was installed on the agency‚Äôs premises, the complaint alleges, without OPM‚Äîthe government‚Äôs human resources department‚Äîconducting a mandatory privacy impact assessment required under federal law. Under the 2002  E-Government Act , agencies are required to perform privacy assessments prior to making ‚Äúsubstantial changes to existing information technology‚Äù when handling information ‚Äúin identifiable form.‚Äù Notably, prior to the installation of the server, OPM did not have the technical capability to email the entire federal workforce from a single email account. ‚Äú[A]t some point after 20 January 2025, OPM allowed unknown individuals to simply bypass its existing systems and security protocols,‚Äù Tuesday‚Äôs motion claims, ‚Äúfor the stated purpose of being able to communicate directly with those individuals without involving other agencies. In short, the sole purpose of these new systems was  expediency .‚Äù OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee with a government agency impacted by this? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Dell Cameron securely at dell.3030 on Signal. If the motion is granted, OPM would be forced to disconnect the server until the assessment is done. As a consequence, the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce would likely face delays. The email account linked to the server‚ÄîHR@opm.gov‚Äîis currently being used to gather information from federal workers accepting buyouts under the admin‚Äôs ‚Äúdeferred resignation program,‚Äù which is set to expire on February 6. ‚ÄúUnder the law, a temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy,‚Äù notes National Security Counselors‚Äô executive director, Kel McClanahan. ‚ÄúBut this is an extraordinary situation.‚Äù Before issuing a restraining order, courts apply what‚Äôs known as the ‚Äúbalance of equities‚Äù doctrine, weighing the burdens and costs on both parties. In this case, however, McClanahan argues that the injunction would inflict ‚Äúno hardship‚Äù on the government whatsoever. February 6 is an ‚Äúarbitrary deadline,‚Äù he says, and the administration could simply continue to implement the resignation program ‚Äúthrough preexisting channels.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe can't wait for the normal course of litigation when all that information is just sitting there in some system nobody knows about with who knows what protections,‚Äù McClanahan says. ‚ÄúIn a normal case, we might be able to at least count on the inspector general to do something, but Trump fired her, so all bets are off.‚Äù The motion further questions whether OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits federal agencies from taking actions ‚Äúnot in accordance with the law.‚Äù Under the APA, courts may ‚Äúcompel agency action‚Äù‚Äîsuch as a private assessment‚Äîwhen it is ‚Äúunlawfully withheld.‚Äù Employees at various agencies were reportedly notified last month to be on the lookout for messages originating from the  HR@opm.gov  account. McClanahan‚Äôs complaint points to a January 23 email from acting Homeland Security secretary Benjamine Huffman instructing DHS employees that the HR@opm.gov account ‚Äúcan be considered trusted.‚Äù In the following days, emails were blasted out twice across the executive branch instructing federal workers to reply ‚ÄúYes‚Äù in both cases. The same account was later used to transmit the ‚ÄúFork in the Road‚Äù missive promoting the Trump administration‚Äôs legally dubious ‚Äúdeferred resignation program,‚Äù which claims to offer federal workers the opportunity to quit but continue receiving paychecks through September. Workers who wished to participate in the program were instructed to reply to the email with ‚ÄúResign.‚Äù As WIRED  has reported , even the new HR chief of DOGE, Musk‚Äôs task force, was unable to answer basic questions about the offer. The legal authority underlying the program is unclear, and federal employee union leaders are warning workers not to blindly assume they will actually get paid. In a floor speech last week, Senator Tim Kaine  advised workers  not to be fooled: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no budget line item to pay people who are not showing up for work.‚Äù Patty Murray, ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, similarly warned Monday: ‚ÄúThere is no funding allocated to agencies to pay staff for this offer.‚Äù McClanahan‚Äôs lawsuit highlights the government‚Äôs response to the OPM hack of 2015, which compromised personnel records on more than 22 million people, including some who‚Äôd undergone background checks to obtain security clearances. A  congressional report  authored by House Republicans following the breach pinned the incident on a ‚Äúbreakdown in communications‚Äù between OPM‚Äôs chief information officer and its inspector general: ‚ÄúThe future effectiveness of the agency‚Äôs information technology and security efforts,‚Äù it says, ‚Äúwill depend on a strong relationship between these two entities moving forward.‚Äù OPM‚Äôs inspector general, Krista Boyd, was fired by President Donald Trump in the midst of the ‚Äú Friday night purge ‚Äù on January 24‚Äîone day after the first HR@opm.gov email was sent. ‚ÄúWe are witnessing an unprecedented exfiltration and seizure of the most sensitive kinds of information by unelected, unvetted people with no experience, responsibility, or right to it,‚Äù says Sean Vitka, policy director at the Demand Progress Education Fund, which is supporting the action. ‚ÄúMillions of Americans and the collective interests of the United States desperately need emergency intervention from the courts.

Yet when it comes to the staff in and around the new administration, it‚Äôs a different story. Just two-and-a-half weeks into Trump‚Äôs second term in office, a fissure has begun to emerge following  Musk‚Äôs DOGE takeover  of the US government, according to a half-dozen  Trump loyalist  Republican aides and advisers inside and around the administration who spoke with WIRED. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more the staff who have an issue with Elon than President Trump,‚Äù a Republican aide familiar with the discussions around DOGE and the administration tells WIRED. This staffer, like others, requested anonymity to relay sensitive conversations due to fears of retaliation. In the space of a couple of weeks, Elon Musk and his associates have taken control of  multiple government agencies , and  a cadre of young and inexperienced engineers  with ties to Musk have been given access to some of the most  highly sensitive federal systems through DOGE.  As Musk‚Äôs associates tore through the federal apparatus over the first weekend of February, a ride-or-die MAGA Republican operative who knows President Trump personally confided something to WIRED they never thought they‚Äôd find themselves saying before the past two weeks. ‚ÄúThere could be a collision course coming here at some point,‚Äù they said when asked if there‚Äôs a brewing freak-out over Musk in Trumpworld. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting too big for his breeches.‚Äù The motivations of the people WIRED has spoken with cover a wide range. Some Trump campaign veterans hope White House chief of staff Susie Wiles will intervene, while other Republican operatives think the emerging rift is a problem despite having no personal animosity toward Musk. Others stand to gain personally or professionally from a Musk ouster. Beyond increasing frustration over Musk causing headaches for the administration‚Äîwhich many of these Republicans consider to be more optics issues than full-blown policy disasters‚Äîthe Republicans who spoke to WIRED had little to no idea what the proper chain of communication is supposed to be between agencies and the White House. On Tuesday, Trump went on Fox News to declare that the new DOGE staffers were actually working in the White House, even though he said he hasn‚Äôt seen them. Minutes prior, a senior White House official told WIRED that ‚ÄúDOGE is part of the White House‚Äù now. (Confusingly, Trump established DOGE by  repurposing  the existing US Digital Service as the US DOGE Service, an agency under the Office of Management and Budget, via executive order.) The Trump White House official said DOGE checks in with them ‚Äúevery day.‚Äù Yet when asked about the nature of these briefings and if they could offer any specifics as to whether they take place on a schedule or with early morning priority, a common practice for those tasked with liaising between agencies and the White House, they had none. The DOGE briefings are ‚Äúas needed,‚Äù the senior White House official said. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee at the Treasury or Bureau of the Fiscal Service? Or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Leak2Lahut.26. What distinguishes this staff-level discontent from the grumblings during the transition about Musk‚Äôs proximity to and  influence over Trump at Mar-a-Lago  is that actual policy decisions are being made‚Äîso many and so fast that it's hard for even the president's most loyal foot soldiers to keep track. While the staff‚Äôs qualms with Musk are rather straightforward, nobody seems to know how to handle the high-velocity and high-volume nature of the DOGE government takeover. ‚ÄúListen, when the process is going this fast, from extreme outsiders, the communication is bound to be a mess,‚Äù says Matthew Bartlett, a Republican operative and former State Department official under Trump in his first term. Bartlett says the rest of Washington is getting their first real taste of the Silicon Valley‚Äìinfluenced attitudes driving much of the private sector, now in the form of twentysomethings from DOGE appearing on government calls. ‚ÄúI mean, listen, this goes to the old adage of Steve Jobs ‚Ä¶ finding you in the elevator and saying, give me 10 seconds to tell me what you do, and justify your job,‚Äù Bartlett claims. ‚ÄúThat is legendary stuff in the private sector‚Äîand maybe it worked‚Äîbut, there are so many nuances to government that it makes addressing and making wide, sweeping changes highly problematic.‚Äù Republicans who landed administration jobs aren‚Äôt exactly shocked a possible rift is emerging. ‚ÄúCan't say a lot of that surprises me to hear,‚Äù an administration source familiar with the discussions tells WIRED. Sources say many people have turned to Wiles as one of the only people who could even attempt to reign in Musk. ‚ÄúSome of it is, she‚Äôs gotta balance being the gatekeeper to the president and having Musk kinda going rogue on a lot of this stuff,‚Äù says the second Republican operative familiar with the discussions. ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs very smart and very talented, and very loyal to President Trump, so she‚Äôll think about how to navigate that best.‚Äù That, of course, depends heavily on her boss‚Äôs desire for any sort of gatekeeping or insulation from the possible looming Musk implosion many of these Republicans are bracing for. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just hearing the president is entirely enthusiastic about his efforts, and they are working together very closely,‚Äù a source close to Trump who speaks with the president regularly told WIRED. ‚ÄúAnd that comes from someone at the very top. Not him, but someone under him.‚Äù Without any tacit approval to step out in front of the boss, the staff are left with no other viable options to express their reservations about how Musk has been operating. Trump‚Äôs own awareness of what DOGE is up to appeared to be in question after his Oval Office news conference on Tuesday. Shortly after he suggested that the federal government should deploy the young DOGE staffers as air traffic controllers‚Äî‚ÄúWe should use some of them in the control towers, where we were putting people that were actually intellectually deficient,‚Äù the president said‚Äîthe same senior White House official quickly dismissed the comment as a serious proposal. ‚ÄúLmfao no,‚Äù the White House official told WIRED in a text message. ‚ÄúYou guys need to learn how to cover him. He was making the point that smart bright people need to be ATC‚Äôs [sic.].‚Äù Trump simultaneously suggested the DOGE staffers are young and ‚Äúvery smart,‚Äù but also that ‚Äúsome are young, and some are not young. Some are not young at all.‚Äù He has  also insisted  everything is fine around Musk‚Äôs role in the administration, and that the billionaire ‚Äú can't do and won't do ‚Äù anything ‚Äúwithout our approval.‚Äù Several Republicans in and around the Trump administration declined to speak on the record about Musk, with one GOP operative summarizing the dynamic as too hot to touch. ‚ÄúOff the record‚Äîyeah, I‚Äôve heard about some of this. But, look, as of now, I‚Äôm gonna keep out of the space between the world‚Äôs richest man and the world‚Äôs most powerful man,‚Äù a Republican operative in Trumpworld told WIRED in an encrypted message, followed by a smiley face emoji. (This Republican later agreed to let WIRED use this quote under the condition of anonymity.) ‚ÄúI have to believe a lot of this is a performance by people who are worried about getting fired,‚Äù a Trump adviser said of the staff‚Äôs patience wearing thin with the world‚Äôs richest man. The dynamic between Trump‚Äôs loyal aides and Musk, already riddled with varying degrees of mistrust over Musk bringing in his own people, is made all the more complicated by the X owner‚Äôs relationship with Florida governor Ron DeSantis‚Äô entourage. Musk‚Äôs ongoing work with the firm Pathway Public P2 Affairs, which is staffed by several alumni of the DeSantis campaign, continues to irk MAGA loyalists who thought DeSantis‚Äô allies would be frozen out of the consulting space after Trump‚Äôs victory. Now, they‚Äôre in ‚Äúthese positions of influence ‚Ä¶ especially with Musk,‚Äù says the second Republican operative. This is a particularly fraught dynamic when it comes to Wiles, who was  iced out by DeSantis  after she helped him become governor of Florida. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs concern about Musk and others being involved with people who went to the mat for Ron DeSantis and spent hundreds of millions of dollars against Donald Trump,‚Äù they later added, after claiming the collision course with Musk could happen sooner than expected. There were also several Trump advisers  ready to go on the record to publicly bash Musk  for what they considered to be his bungled get-out-the-vote effort through America PAC after the general election, should Trump have lost. WIRED reported extensively on the working conditions of door knockers for contractors for America PAC, including a group of canvassers in Michigan who were  driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul moving van  and threatened to have their pay and lodging withheld if they did not hit their quotas for Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor for Musk‚Äôs PAC. ‚ÄúOperatives that really know what‚Äôs going on, people want an audit of America PAC for the sake of America First,‚Äù a Republican operative tells WIRED. Some of these Republicans, it seems, want a DOGE for Musk‚Äôs outside political operation. ‚ÄúThe point is, who is auditing?‚Äù says the second Trumpworld operative. What‚Äôs most notable about these Republicans reaching the limit of their patience with Musk is that for the most part, they were pretty big fans until recent weeks. ‚ÄúI think people have been very annoyed by it,‚Äù said the Republican who wants an audit of America PAC. ‚ÄúAnd I mean, look, I think Elon's really important. Everyone's grateful. It's just sort of an unnecessary situation.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-aides-concern-musk-takeover/"},

But his professional and online history call into question whether he would pass the background check typically required to obtain security clearances, security experts tell WIRED. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old high school graduate, established at least five different companies in the last four years, with entities registered in Connecticut, Delaware, and the United Kingdom, most of which were not listed on his now-deleted LinkedIn profile. Coristine also briefly worked in 2022 at Path Network, a network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers. Someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine also solicited a cyberattack-for-hire service later that year. Coristine did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One of the companies Coristine founded, Tesla.Sexy LLC, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old. Coristine is  listed as the founder and CEO of the company , according to business records reviewed by WIRED. Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains. One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review. \"Foreign connections, whether it's foreign contacts with friends or domain names registered in foreign countries, would be flagged by any agency during the security investigation process,\" Joseph Shelzi, a former US Army intelligence officer who held security clearance for a decade and managed the security clearance of other units under his command, tells WIRED. A longtime former US intelligence analyst, who requested anonymity to speak on sensitive topics, agrees. ‚ÄúThere's little chance that he could have passed a background check for privileged access to government systems,‚Äù they allege. Another domain under Coristine‚Äôs control is faster.pw. The website is currently inactive, but an  archived version  from October 25, 2022 shows content in Chinese that stated the service helped provide ‚Äúmultiple encrypted cross-border networks.‚Äù Prior to joining DOGE, Coristine worked for several months of 2024 at Elon Musk‚Äôs Neuralink brain implant startup, and,  as WIRED previously reported , is now listed in Office of Personnel Management records as an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù at that agency, which oversees personnel matters for the federal government. Employees of the General Services Administration say he also joined calls where they were made to justify their jobs and to review code they‚Äôve written. Other elements of Coristine‚Äôs personal record reviewed by WIRED, government security experts say, would also raise questions about obtaining security clearances necessary to access privileged government data. These same experts further wonder about the vetting process for DOGE staff‚Äîand, given Coristine‚Äôs history, whether he underwent any such background check. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about what level of clearance, if any, Corisitine has and, if so, how it was granted. At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn r√©sum√©. Path has at times listed as employees Eric Taylor,  also known as Cosmo the God , a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It‚Äôs unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company. ‚ÄúIf I was doing the background investigation on him, I would probably have recommended against hiring him for the work he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù says EJ Hilbert, a former FBI agent who also briefly served as the CEO of Path Network prior to Coristine‚Äôs employment there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not opposed to the idea of cleaning up the government.

Potential concerns about Coristine extend beyond his work history. Archived Telegram messages shared with WIRED show that, in November 2022, a person using the handle ‚ÄúJoeyCrafter‚Äù posted to a Telegram channel focused on so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberattacks that bombard victim sites with junk traffic to knock them offline. In his messages, JoeyCrafter‚Äîwhich records from Discord, Telegram, and the networking protocol BGP indicate was a handle used by Coristine‚Äîwrites that he‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking for a capable, powerful and reliable L7‚Äù that accepts bitcoin payments. That line, in the context of a DDoS-for-hire Telegram channel, suggests he was looking for someone who could carry out a layer-7 attack, a certain form of DDoS. A DDoS-for-hire service with the name Dstat.cc was seized in a multinational law enforcement operation last year. The JoeyCrafter Telegram account had previously used the name ‚ÄúRivage,‚Äù a name linked to Coristine on Discord and at Path, according to Path internal communications shared with WIRED. Both the Rivage Discord and Telegram accounts at times promoted Coristine‚Äôs DiamondCDN startup. It‚Äôs not clear whether the JoeyCrafter message was followed by an actual DDoS attack. (In the internal messages among Path staff, a question is asked about Rivage, at which point an individual clarifies they are speaking about ‚ÄúEdward.‚Äù) \"It does depend on which government agency is sponsoring your security clearance request, but everything that you've just mentioned would absolutely raise red flags during the investigative process,\" says Shelzi, the former US Army intelligence officer. He adds that a secret security clearance could be completed in as little as 50 days, while a top-secret security clearance could take anywhere from 90 days to a year to complete. Coristine‚Äôs online history, including a LinkedIn account where he calls himself Big Balls, has disappeared recently. He also previously used an account on X with the username @edwardbigballer. The account had a bio that read: ‚ÄúTechnology. Arsenal. Golden State Warriors. Space Travel.‚Äù Prior to using the @edwardbigballer username, Coristine was linked to an account featuring the screen name ‚ÄúSteven French‚Äù featuring a picture of what appears to be Humpty Dumpty smoking a cigar. In multiple posts from 2020 and 2021, the account can be seen responding to posts from Musk. Coristine‚Äôs X account is currently set to private. Davi Ottenheimer, a longtime security operations and compliance manager, says many factors about Coristine‚Äôs employment history and online footprint could raise questions about his ability to obtain security clearance. ‚ÄúLimited real work experience is a risk,‚Äù says Ottenheimer, as an example. ‚ÄúPlus his handle is literally Big Balls.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/edward-coristine-tesla-sexy-path-networks-doge/"},

An internal email obtained by WIRED shows that the NOAA‚Äôs National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received orders to pause ‚ÄúALL INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS.‚Äù (Emphasis theirs.) The message states that the orders extend to participation in international commissions and even emails ‚Äúwith foreign national colleagues.‚Äù The email further instructs NMFS employees‚Äîresponsible for promoting the conservation of sea life and sustainability of America‚Äôs seafood sources‚Äîto submit details of any ongoing work with international partners for vetting by higher-ups, including those at the US Department of Commerce, the NOAA‚Äôs umbrella agency. The NOAA and the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The motive behind the incommunicado orders is not immediately clear, nor is it clear how long they will last. According to a source with knowledge of NMFS operations, granted anonymity because‚Äîas with other sources in this story‚Äîthey were not authorized to speak to the press, NOAA officials discussed in a meeting Wednesday feeling targeted by the Trump administration, saying their work faces ‚Äúhuge exposure‚Äù due to offshore wind projects and  participation  in international wind energy workshops, conferences, and summits. The agency had been anticipating, for example, hosting international fellows and interns this summer associated with an offshore wind development  working group  founded by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the world's oldest intergovernmental science organization. President Donald Trump issued an  executive order  on his first day in office designed to paralyze growth in wind energy. In a postinaugural speech,  he told rally-goers : ‚ÄúWe're not going to do the wind thing.‚Äù According to another source at the NOAA, the incommunicado orders extend to the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. In addition to gathering data from across the federal government, NESDIS relies on a wide range of international partners. NESDIS‚Äôs weather and climate data is essential not only to air transportation safety but also to combat drought, monitor coral reef destruction, and safeguard railway shipping carriers against dangerous weather. According to NESDIS‚Äôs  website , it works closely with the European Space Agency, which provides access to data via a collection of Sentinel satellites maintained by EUMETSAT, an international weather-monitoring agency composed of more than 30 member states. WIRED  reported Wednesday  that NOAA officials had been ordered to grant Nikhil Rajpal, a former Twitter employee who appears to have no expertise in ocean and atmospheric science, the power to edit documents concerning the agency‚Äôs work hosted by Google Sites. The orders, sources said, came from acting commerce secretary Jeremy Pelter. Government records show Rajpal now has working email addresses with both the NOAA and Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficient (DOGE) task force. WIRED has also learned that Rajpal is listed as an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù on a roster at the Office of Personnel Management, the government‚Äôs human resources department, where DOGE operatives have installed a server gathering information on federal employees that has been used to repeatedly communicate the administration‚Äôs deferred resignation program.

There will be some additional foreign workers retained, two USAID employees tell WIRED, but it is unclear how many. ‚ÄúThere are more impoverished people in Asia than anywhere else, and our presence has always helped counter the influence of China,‚Äù says one USAID employee, who was granted anonymity due to fears of retaliation and because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency.

One of his first actions after taking office last month was to sign an executive order to freeze foreign aid, much of which is implemented by USAID. Already, the change has stymied anti-human-trafficking work, including projects that help people escape from labor compounds where they are enslaved and forced to commit digital fraud, WIRED  reported  on Wednesday. Although the administration subsequently clarified that ‚Äúlifesaving‚Äù work would be allowed to continue under an emergency waiver program, the chaotic takeover of the agency has made this impossible in practice. As WIRED  reported  on Monday, vital HIV/AIDS work has been disrupted, with workers on the ground in countries like Haiti unable to access antiretroviral medications‚Äîeven though much of that work was technically granted a waiver. Meanwhile, some current employees stationed abroad have yet to be informed of the agency‚Äôs latest changes. ‚ÄúThe only official communication I‚Äôve received is from the local embassy State Department facilities people, asking if or when we were moving out so they could renovate our houses,‚Äù says one USAID worker stationed overseas.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-guts-usaid-workforce/"},

WIRED reporting shows, however, that at the time these statements were made, a DOGE operative did in fact have write access. Not only that, but sources tell WIRED that at least one note was added to Treasury records indicating that he no longer had write access before senior IT staff stated it was actually rescinded. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old DOGE technologist, was recently installed at the Treasury Department as a special government employee. One of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are currently associated with DOGE, Elez previously worked for SpaceX, Musk‚Äôs space company, and X, Musk‚Äôs social media company. Elez resigned Thursday after The Wall Street Journal  inquired  about his connections to ‚Äúa deleted social-media account that advocated for racism and eugenics.‚Äù As WIRED  has reported , Elez was granted privileges including the ability to not just read but write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the  Payment Automation Manager  (PAM) and  Secure Payment System  (SPS) at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), an agency that according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. Reporting from  Talking Points Memo  confirmed that Treasury employees were concerned that Elez had already made ‚Äúextensive changes‚Äù to code within the Treasury system. The payments processed by BFS include federal tax returns, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and veteran‚Äôs pay. Over the last week, the nuts and bolts of DOGE‚Äôs access to the Treasury has been at the center of an escalating crisis. On January 31, David Lebryk, the most senior career civil servant in the Treasury, announced he would retire; he had been placed on administrative leave after refusing to give Musk‚Äôs DOGE team access to the federal payment system. The next morning, sources tell WIRED, Elez was granted read and write access to PAM and SPS. On February 3,  Politico reported  that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Republican lawmakers in the House Financial Services Committee that Musk and DOGE didn‚Äôt have control over key Treasury systems. The same day,  The New York Times reported  that Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that DOGE‚Äôs access was ‚Äúread-only.‚Äù Got a Tip?

The significance of this is that the ability to alter the code on these systems would in theory give a DOGE technologist‚Äîand, by extension, Musk, President Donald Trump, or other actors‚Äîthe capability to, among other things, illegally cut off Congressionally authorized payments to specific individuals or entities. (CNN  reported  on Thursday that Musk associates had demanded that Treasury pause authorized payments to USAID, precipitating Lebryk‚Äôs resignation.) On February 4, WIRED reported that Elez did, in fact, have admin access to PAM and SPS. Talking Points Memo  reported  later that day that Elez had ‚Äúmade extensive changes to the code base for these critical payment systems.‚Äù In a  letter  that same day that did not mention Musk or DOGE, Treasury official Jonathan Blum wrote to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, ‚ÄúCurrently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee, will have read-only to the coded data of the Fiscal Service‚Äôs payment systems.‚Äù (Krause is the top DOGE operative at Treasury and CEO of Cloud Software Group.) The letter did not say what kind of access the staff members actually had. Sources tell WIRED that by afternoon of the next day, February 5, Elez‚Äôs access had been changed to ‚Äúread-only‚Äù from both read and code-writing privileges. That same day, a federal judge granted an order to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and changing Treasury payment system information, following a lawsuit alleging the Treasury Department provided ‚ÄúElon Musk or other individuals associated with DOGE‚Äù with access to the payment systems, and that this access violated federal privacy laws. The  order  specifically provided a carve-out for two individuals: Krause and Elez. At a court hearing later that day, Department of Justice lawyer Bradley Humphreys  asserte d that the order said their access would be ‚Äúread-only.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a distinction without a difference,‚Äù a source told WIRED. Referring specifically to the PAM, through which $4.7 trillion flowed in fiscal year 2024, they said Elez should not have had ‚Äúaccess to this almost $5 trillion payment flow, even if it‚Äôs ‚Äòread-only.‚Äô None of this should be happening.‚Äù The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The  DOGE  address, like others from the agency, is in a format tying it to the Executive Office of the President. Rajpal also appears in the NOAA‚Äôs public-facing employee directory. According to sources familiar with the situation, on Wednesday, NOAA employees were ordered to grant Rajpal editor access to all NOAA Google sites on instructions of the acting commerce secretary, Jeremy Pelter, by the close of business. An NOAA employee with more than 40 years of service who led the agency‚Äôs work on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility was, according to these sources, placed on administrative leave Tuesday, three weeks ahead of their scheduled retirement.

His administration later clarified that programs carrying out lifesaving work such as providing medical and food assistance could receive humanitarian waivers to continue, but a number of organizations around the world say that the process has been mired in confusion and chaos. Even vital HIV and AIDS prevention work  has been stymied , WIRED reported Monday. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took acting control of USAID on Monday, speculated that if aid organizations had any misunderstandings, that was a reflection of their incompetence. ‚ÄúIf some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization,‚Äù Rubio said. He added that perhaps some groups were ‚Äúdeliberately sabotaging\" the process to make ‚Äúa political point.‚Äù When he was a US senator, Rubio repeatedly voiced support for some US foreign aid programs. ‚ÄúForeign aid is not charity,‚Äù he  said on social media  in 2017. ‚ÄúWe must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.‚Äù In 2019, Rubio  said he was working on  ‚Äúgetting Congressional support for a multilateral humanitarian aid plan so we can get food & medicine to the suffering people of Venezuela.‚Äù (Florida, where Rubio is from, is home to a large Venezuelan population.)

In a striking example of the policy in action, an image  surfaced last week  of a wall being painted over at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Quantico, Virginia, academy due to it listing \"diversity\" among the bureau's core values. (According to an email from the FBI‚Äôs Office of Integrity and Compliance  obtained by Mother Jones , the bureau no longer counts \"diversity\" among its core values.) The Trump administration began a radical campaign last week aimed at inducing members of the federal workforce to leave their jobs ahead of threatened reductions. The effort is spearheaded by Elon Musk, leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force that has effectively seized control of several federal agencies and sensitive government systems with apparent clearance from the White House. WIRED reported last week that Musk‚Äôs outfit had effectively taken over the  Office of Personnel Management , the US government‚Äôs human resources department. In this and other efforts, it is employing  inexperienced young engineers  whose ages range from 19 to 24‚Äîmany of whom, public records show, are former interns or have been affiliated with Musk-aligned companies. OPM  emailed federal workers  on January 28 with a ‚Äúdeferred resignation offer,‚Äù sparking widespread confusion among federal workers. (DOGE‚Äôs own new HR chief was unable to answer basic questions about the offer in a contentious staff meeting last week,  WIRED reported .) In an email to staff Sunday evening, OPM clarified whether the deferred resignation program complied with existing privacy laws. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù read the answer. ‚ÄúThe deferred resignation program uses only basic contact information about federal employees, like name and government address, along with short, voluntary email responses. The information is stored on government systems.

Since Musk's USDS takeover, sources claim, the original USDS staff has had very little contact with Musk‚Äôs team. A DOGE representative was expected to join several USDS meetings last week, but they did not show up. The only time legacy staff have met with recently installed personnel was a Friday  meeting with DOGE‚Äôs HR chief, Stephanie Holmes , which WIRED first reported. In that meeting, Holmes was unable to provide many answers to a slew of questions related to the deferred resignations program offered to most federal employees. ‚ÄúThem not showing up shows that they clearly do not give a fuck about us,‚Äù one source told WIRED. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô because we wait for them to come and they don‚Äôt.‚Äù Without new directives, USDS sources tell WIRED they‚Äôve been operating as if things are ‚Äúbusiness as usual,‚Äù continuing work on long-term projects that have carried over from President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt talk to us,‚Äù one USDS employee tells WIRED. ‚ÄúAs far as I can tell, they‚Äôre hiding,‚Äù says another. The Musk team‚Äôs aloofness underscores the secrecy surrounding DOGE staff. Last week,  WIRED reported that unnamed, young engineers  were tasked with interviewing staff at USDS and the General Services Administration and at times reviewing code. ‚ÄúWe're afraid of those folks' names getting out and their personal lives being disrupted, which is exactly what happened last week, which is really unfortunate for them,‚Äù Thomas Shedd, director of GSA‚Äôs Technology Transformation Service,  said in a meeting with staff on Monday .

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Former USDS deputy administrator Ted Carstensen, the highest-ranking USDS official outside of Musk‚Äôs orbit,  resigned on Thursday . He repeatedly invited members of Musk‚Äôs team, including DOGE senior adviser Steve Davis, to join staff meetings, sources tell WIRED, but they never showed. Two sources said that Carstensen was repeatedly left out of leadership meetings and felt kept out of the loop on decisionmaking. Carstensen was supposed to meet with Holmes on Wednesday, a source said, but the meeting was canceled last minute. In a resignation email viewed by WIRED, Carstensen confirmed that Thursday would be his final day. He said that he would not be taking the deferred resignation offer that has colloquially been called ‚Äúthe fork‚Äù after the  Fork in the Road email  federal workers received last week offering them continued pay and benefits through September 30. ‚ÄúThis was not an easy decision for me to make as my time at the US Digital Service has been one of the best periods in my career. I believe wholeheartedly in the mission and have been inspired every day by the commitment, kindness, and intelligence of the team,‚Äù Carstensen wrote. ‚ÄúIt was important for me to get the team to a place where everyone could choose their own path forward, which is where we find ourselves today. I hope each of you lands on the path that‚Äôs best for you, and I look forward to staying in touch and seeing where it takes you.‚Äù Carstensen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carstensen‚Äôs decision to refuse the ‚Äúfork‚Äù deal echoes a similar sentiment held among the broader USDS staff. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a strong feeling within USDS that people don‚Äôt want to take the fork because they don‚Äôt want to send the message that they're somehow accepting or approving of the larger plan,‚Äù a USDS source said. In an internal meeting following Carstensen‚Äôs departure, staff were told that he would not be replaced and that his responsibilities would be spread across the rest of the organization, a source said. Within the meeting, staff members lamented the state of the organization, fearing Carstensen‚Äôs departure showed that Musk and his team were in full control. ‚ÄúIt's almost indisputable that USDS is in the endgame,‚Äù one person in the meeting said. ‚ÄúTime to start loading into the life boats,‚Äù said another.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/musk-doge-firewall-usds-workers/"},

As part of a broad effort to bypass Congress and unilaterally cut government spending, Donald Trump‚Äôs administration has all but shut down operations at the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, the independent federal body that delivers humanitarian aid and economic development funding around the world. On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order pausing all USAID funding, and the agency subsequently issued a stop-work order to nearly all funding recipients, from soup kitchens in Sudan to the global humanitarian group Mercy Corps. Since then, Elon Musk‚Äôs new Department of Government Efficiency has shut down the agency‚Äôs website, locked employees out of their email accounts, and closed the agency‚Äôs Washington office. ‚ÄúUSAID is a criminal organization,‚Äù Musk posted on X on Sunday. ‚ÄúTime for it to die.‚Äù (The agency is codified in federal law, and court challenges are likely to argue that Musk‚Äôs actions are themselves illegal.) While criticisms of Trump‚Äôs abrupt demolition of USAID have largely focused on global public health projects that have long enjoyed bipartisan support, the effort also threatens billions of dollars meant to combat climate change. USAID‚Äôs climate-related funding helps low-income countries build renewable energy and adapt to worsening natural disasters, as well as conserve carbon sinks and sensitive ecosystems. During Joe Biden‚Äôs administration, USAID accelerated its climate-focused efforts as part of an  ambitious new initiative  that was supposed to last through the end of the decade. That effort now appears to have come to an abrupt end as USAID contractors around the world prepare to  abandon critical projects and lay off staff . Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has taken over USAID as acting director, has said that Musk‚Äôs abrupt shutdown is ‚Äúnot about getting rid of foreign aid.‚Äù But even if USAID eventually resumes operations to provide emergency humanitarian assistance such as famine support and HIV prevention, the agency is still likely to terminate all its climate-related work under the Trump administration. The result would be a blow to the landmark Paris climate agreement just as significant as Trump‚Äôs formal withdrawal of the US from the international pact. By clawing back billions of dollars that Congress has already committed to the fight against global warming, the US is poised to derail climate progress far beyond its own borders. ‚ÄúThis is taking a torch to development programs that the American people have paid for,‚Äù said Gillian Caldwell, who served as USAID‚Äôs chief climate officer under former president Biden. ‚ÄúMany commitments under the Paris Agreement are funding-contingent, and that‚Äôs very much in peril.‚Äù The United States spends less than 1 percent of its federal budget on foreign aid, but that still makes the country the largest aid donor in the world by far. USAID distributes between $40 billion and $60 billion per year‚Äîalmost a quarter of all global humanitarian aid. While in recent years the largest shares of that aid have gone to Ukraine, Israel, and Afghanistan, the agency also distributes billions of dollars to Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, where it primarily helps promote food security, health and sanitation, and education efforts. In 2022, Caldwell led the launch of a sweeping new ‚Äúclimate strategy‚Äù that sought to reposition USAID‚Äôs work over the next decade to account for climate shocks. The first part of this initiative was a country-by-country review of existing aid flows in standard areas like food and sanitation. USAID offices around the world began tweaking their operations to ensure the projects they were funding would hold up as temperatures continue to rise. For example, the agency would ensure water and sewer systems could handle bigger floods, or would plan to inoculate against  diseases that might spread faster in warm weather . The effort was especially important in sectors like agriculture, which is both emissions-heavy and extremely vulnerable to the weather shocks that come with even small climactic shifts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be having a lot more demands on humanitarian assistance when you‚Äôve got extreme weather events,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe point was to make sure that every dollar we‚Äôre spending is sensible given the world we live in today.‚Äù In addition to that review, the agency also increased its direct spending on renewable energy, conservation, and climate adaptation. The agency added dozens of new countries to its climate aid portfolio under Biden‚Äôs tenure, expanding in Southeast Asia and Western Africa. USAID work has had a far greater effect on the climate fight than its raw spending, which totaled around $600 million on climate efforts in 2023, would indicate. That‚Äôs because the agency‚Äôs support has also mobilized billions of dollars from the private sector, attracting investment from renewable energy developers and insurance companies that offer drought and flood coverage to vulnerable areas abroad. USAID‚Äôs renewable energy efforts may be some of the most resilient to Trump‚Äôs shock attack, because they don‚Äôt rely on the agency‚Äôs continued involvement. USAID has helped several countries design and hold renewable energy auctions, wherein private companies bid for the right to build new power facilities at low prices. These auctions save countries money and make it easier for them to attract private capital. In the Philippines,  two USAID-sponsored auctions  generated almost $7 billion in investment to build 5.4 gigawatts of solar and wind energy, enough to power millions of homes‚Äîwithout further USAID support. The agency‚Äôs  spending on landscape conservation  is less secure. That funding prevents development on sensitive natural environments like rainforests by paying nearby residents to seek livelihoods other than the logging and grazing that could unleash massive emissions from the carbon stored in the forests. If USAID collapses, that aid will dry up, jeopardizing millions of acres of climate-friendly land. The largest portion of the USAID‚Äôs climate-related spending goes toward disaster resilience, which doesn‚Äôt attract much investment from banks and private companies, making government support crucial. In the case of Zimbabwe, for instance, the agency funds dozens of projects a year that are intended to make the country‚Äôs farmers more resilient to drought and flooding. (This is in addition to public health and AIDS relief provided to the country, which together account for the majority of its USAID funding.) Women use a depleted well in rural Zimbabwe in the summer of 2024, during an El Ni√±o-induced drought. USAID has spent millions of dollars on drought support in the country. \n Photograph: JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/Getty Images One of the largest disaster relief programs in Zimbabwe, a broad-based initiative to  help smallholder farmers , has increased water stability for tens of thousands of households by helping them build small rain catchment systems and restore degraded soils. USAID has been funding the project to the tune of about $12 million annually since 2020, and the program was slated to continue for the next three years. Zimbabwe‚Äôs minister for climate and the environment, Washington Zhakata, said that a shutoff of USAID funding will make it nearly impossible for the country to meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement. The country has promised not only to develop renewable energy, but also to spend huge amounts of money on drought and flood protections. It has developed a nationwide adaptation plan on the premise that future funding would be provided‚Äîand provided in large part by the countries that are responsible for the most carbon emissions historically, like the US. ‚ÄúWith limited and reduced resources, as a result of the funding withdrawal, meeting our compliance will be an uphill task,‚Äù Zhakata told Grist. ‚ÄúThe created finance gap will see developing countries have to live with minimum resources and also to squeeze from domestic sources.‚Äù At times, USAID has faced criticism for inefficient spending and unclear results‚Äîincluding for its past climate spending. The agency‚Äôs inspector general released a report last summer that criticized USAID‚Äôs previous climate initiatives for having murky data, saying that ‚Äúweaknesses in the agency‚Äôs processes for awarding funds, managing performance, and communicating climate change information could impede successful implementation.‚Äù The inspector general‚Äôs report also called USAID‚Äôs measurements of climate progress into question. In another  report last year , the agency said that its new clean energy investments in Pakistan will cut around 55 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, the equivalent of taking around 10 million average cars off the road. In Brazil, the agency said it has conserved around 118 million acres of forest land, which will sequester millions of tons of carbon. The inspector general said results like these are ‚Äúhighly susceptible to inaccuracies,‚Äù because the emissions results haven‚Äôt yet happened. Some experts also argue that the agency‚Äôs humanitarian aid programs don‚Äôt focus enough on reducing long-term risk. Food security specialists who spoke to Grist during a  2023 famine in Somalia  said that USAID provided emergency food assistance in the country as pastoralists lost their income, but it didn‚Äôt provide enough funding to help those shepherds adapt to future droughts. Caldwell, the former USAID climate officer, said the agency has reduced long-term risk by trying to reduce emissions on emergency aid deliveries and ensure new infrastructure can survive future disasters. While the first Trump administration tried to zero out climate aid in every round of annual budget negotiations,  some Senate Republicans resisted  and kept aid flows more or less level. This time around, there‚Äôs no guarantee that Republicans in Congress will show the same resistance to Trump‚Äôs demands‚Äîand no guarantee that the administration will comply with laws requiring it to spend the money that Congress appropriates. If Musk, whom Trump has made a special government employee to conduct his Department of Government Efficiency vision, overcomes court challenges and succeeds in clearing out USAID staff and shutting down the agency‚Äôs typical operations, it will take a new administration and years of work to restore the flow of climate aid, assuming Congress votes to restore it as well. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, but the US is still a member of the broader United Nations climate convention, and only Congress has the power to withdraw it from that convention. The original framework text, which the US adopted in 1992, says that rich countries like the US ‚Äúshall provide‚Äù aid to help poorer countries meet their climate goals. In a statement about the USAID shutdown, Manish Bapna, head of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, connected the shuttering of USAID to Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from the 2015 Paris accord. ‚ÄúSimilar to the Paris climate agreement exit, this action simply narrows the window for essential climate and global health actions, while delivering no benefit to American taxpayers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is a curiously counterproductive and poorly timed move that comes as the world is facing grave climate, health, environmental, and economic crises‚Äîall of which will be worsened by this assault on USAID.‚Äù Editor‚Äôs note: The Natural Resources Defense Council is an advertiser with Grist.

Marko Elez , one of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are associated with DOGE, was granted read and write privileges on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the  Payment Automation Manager  and  Secure Payment System  at the BFS, an agency that according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. ‚ÄúThere is reporting at other federal agencies indicating that DOGE members have performed unauthorized changes and locked civil servants out of the sensitive systems they gained access to,‚Äù the ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù portion of the email continues. ‚ÄúWe further recommend that DOGE members be placed under insider threat monitoring and alerting after their access to payment systems is revoked. Continued access to any payment systems by DOGE members, even ‚Äòread only,‚Äô likely poses the single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.‚Äù The recommendations were part of a weekly report sent out by the BFS threat intelligence team to hundreds of staffers. ‚ÄúInsider threat risks are something [the threat intelligence team] usually covers,‚Äù a source told WIRED. ‚ÄúBut they have never identified something inside the bureau as an insider threat risk that I know of.‚Äù The Treasury Department and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some of the engineers are associated with data analytics firm Palantir or its cofounder and board of directors chair‚Äîand Musk ally‚ÄîPeter Thiel. As DOGE staffers‚Äîmany of them  young and with little or no government experience ‚Äîcontinue to gain access to sensitive data across about a dozen government agencies, this is the first look at some of the networks from which the agency has recruited, and who they relied on to enlist talent. In online chat groups linked to Palantir alumni and SpaceX interns, Musk‚Äôs space company, as well as in a Discord server associated with a military artificial intelligence program, the engineers said they were looking for people willing to spend six months in Washington, DC, cutting federal spending‚Äîwhich accounts for around a quarter of the US gross domestic product‚Äîby a third. Anthony Jancso, one of three engineers associated with the recruitment effort, is a former Palantir employee. According to sources, Jancso said he was recruited to DOGE by Steve Davis, the Boring Company president and Musk lieutenant whom Bloomberg  reported  in December was leading recruitment for DOGE. Palantir, Jancso, and Davis did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jancso‚Äôs r√©sum√© lists him as a 2021 graduate of University College London and as having been a ‚Äúforward deployed‚Äù software engineer at Palantir between December 2021 and May 2023. Jancso is best known for leading a project called Accelerate SF, which aims to leverage AI in the public sector. In a 2023 story about a then upcoming hackathon,  VentureBeat  reported that Accelerate had received support from companies including OpenAI and Anthropic. In 2024, the venture  became  known as AccelerateX. Purporting to offer ‚Äúa modern OS for government,‚Äù AccelerateX  claims  it ‚Äútransforms government infrastructure with AI-powered automation and software, delivered in days.‚Äù On November 26, 2024, in a message reviewed by WIRED, a person using a screen name including the name Anthony and the same handle that Jancso uses on his X account posted in a Discord server associated with the  Space Force Generative AI Challenge ‚Äîan ‚Äúeight-week combination of AI crash course and problem-solving hack-a-thon that engaged 350-plus participants,‚Äù according to its website. ‚ÄúHelping the Dept. of Government Efficiency team find hardcore engineers,‚Äù the message reads. ‚ÄúSend your GitHub/LinkedIn to @DOGE on X and your X handle to me in DM if you‚Äôre interested or know someone who is, could help get them into the pipeline.‚Äù In early December, in another message reviewed by WIRED, a person using the same handle posted to a chat group for Palantir alumni. ‚ÄúHey all,‚Äù the message read. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm helping Elon‚Äôs team find tech talent for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the new admin. This is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3.

I‚Äôve always found Palantirians & ex-Palantirians to be the most exceptional people I know, so who better to confront that challenge. Shoot me a DM (or @Anthony ofc) if you‚Äôre interested.‚Äù (Reaction to these messages was, a source tells WIRED, ‚Äúmixed.‚Äù) According to an online r√©sum√©, George Cooper graduated from Lehigh University in 2019 and has been employed at Palantir as a ‚Äúforward deployed‚Äù engineer since May 2024, following another stint at the company in a similar role from 2019 to 2023. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It‚Äôs unclear what role, if any, Jancso currently has within DOGE. But one of Accelerate SF‚Äôs cofounders, as reported by VentureBeat, is former Waymo software engineer Jordan Wick, who completed undergrad at MIT in 2019 and earned a masters from the school the following year. Wick, according to government records reviewed by WIRED, appears to have a DOGE email account associated with the Executive Office of the President. Two sources tell WIRED that Wick is among the team that has been  given access to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  systems and equipment. Wick did not immediately respond to a request from WIRED. Shortly after the email was sent, his online r√©sum√© was removed. On December 5, 2024, around the same time the messages associated with Jancso‚Äôs handle were being sent out, a person using the handle Luke Farritor posted a message in a Discord server for SpaceX interns. ‚ÄúHi everyone! I‚Äôm recruiting SWEs for Doge. Reach out if interested!‚Äù the message reads. ‚ÄúWe are looking for skilled software engineers (and ops people) at any career stage who are willing to work for ~6mo in person in DC. Paid. Tons of really ambitious projects in the works. We are going to fix the government!‚Äù The six-month timeline aligns with the 130-workday limit that special government employees (SGEs) are legally allowed to serve in a single year. Musk himself is currently categorized as an SGE. Luke Farritor, as WIRED  first reported , is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern and Thiel Fellow now working as a DOGE technologist. Politico has  reported  that he is now listed as an information engineer in an internal directory at the Department of Energy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since its establishment by executive order on the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency, DOGE has taken over key agencies at the center of the federal government, such as the  Office of Personnel Management  and the  General Services Administration , and placed operatives in  about a dozen agencies  with the apparent aim of radically reducing the size of the federal workforce and increasing presidential powers. Its access to sensitive data and systems has placed DOGE at the center of a growing number of legal battles. Early Saturday morning, a federal judge temporarily  barred  members of the task force from access to records and the  Treasury payment system  through which the vast majority of federal spending flows, and ordered records in their possession destroyed immediately. As WIRED has  reported , a threat intelligence team at the agency recommended members have access to payment systems revoked and that they be monitored as an ‚Äúinsider threat.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/"},

Multiple children‚Äôs safety groups‚Äîincluding those fighting online child sexual abuse and exploitation‚Äîsay their efforts have been severely hamstrung. Groups identifying victims and providing care for those who have been subject to online exploitation or human trafficking are struggling to support the vulnerable children, multiple organizations tell WIRED. Such child safety projects often take place in poorer countries, which can have fewer resources to support victims or investigate crimes. Sources say that funding for safe houses has been paused, potentially exposing victims to more harm, and efforts that identify criminals behind child exploitation have been put on hold. ‚ÄúIt will be very hard for us to identify the victims,‚Äù says Chantal Yelu Mulop, from the Coordination for Youth and the Fight Against Sexual Violence and Trafficking in Persons (CJVFFT), in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the  war-torn country faces new fighting and humanitarian crises , children have long been trafficked to work in cobalt mines linked to the  production of smartphone and EV batteries . As USAID funding was withdrawn over the past week, Mulop says her organization had just started helping around 25 newly identified victims of human trafficking‚Äîall of them aged under 17. The group was taken to a support shelter run by another organization. ‚ÄúWhen we bring them there, USAID was ready to help. A few hours later they cancel,‚Äù Mulop says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no food, no nothing that we can provide to them,‚Äù she adds. While the USAID cuts have been immediate, global child protection projects have also faced a funding pause from the State Department. This foreign aid ‚Äú pause ,‚Äù issued by the Trump administration, is set to last for at least 90 days. USAID did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. The State Department had not provided a comment by time of publication. Both government bodies have provided funding to help countries and people around the world. This includes USAID‚Äôs vast swath of health care and education programs‚Äîtheir withdrawal is  putting millions of lives at risk  and  limits tackling the climate crisis . In Southeast Asia, several patients at a migrant camp reportedly  died after medical support was removed . Counter-human-trafficking funding often includes money for projects that help to crack down on online child exploitation and sexual abuse. Funding can be provided to international organizations that coordinate efforts and work with partners, like Mulop‚Äôs CJVFFT, on the ground. The funding can directly support victims, as well as providing expertise to officials in countries, and stop more children becoming targets. ‚ÄúMany of these victims engage with their traffickers through electronic means,‚Äù says Jessica Ryckman, the executive director of the nonprofit Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB), which works on trafficking and child exploitation programs and has been impacted by the funding changes. ‚ÄúIt is exploitation that is advanced through digital technology.‚Äù Over the years, the programs have been effective. For instance, a four-year partnership between the US and the Philippines, which started under the first Trump administration and ended in 2021, helped protect hundreds of children: More than  350 kids were rescued and supported and almost 100 potential criminals arrested . The new cuts also come as  record levels  of online child sexual abuse imagery are being discovered. ‚ÄúVictims and perpetrators alike originate from diverse regions and countries, underscoring the necessity for continued international engagement and coordinated efforts to address these crimes comprehensively,‚Äù says an employee of a South American child protection group that works to combat trafficking and online sexual abuse. The organization, like others in this story, was granted anonymity to speak given the sensitive nature of the work and uncertainty about future funding. ‚ÄúThe interruption of these funds inevitably limits the scope and reach of these critical services,‚Äù it says. One person, who works for an organization running multiple child protection projects, says operations in one southeastern European country have been widely disrupted. Within the country, the organization‚Äôs projects have 147 victims of trafficking in its care, the person says. ‚ÄúThe ongoing pause and potentially the cessation of funding would have significant and negative impact on our capacity and ability to provide essential services to these victims who are in fragile stages of their recovery; some of whom are in ongoing programs for psycho-social counseling related to their trauma,‚Äù the person says. Multiple members of LWOB say children are being put further at risk in the projects it runs in East Africa. ‚ÄúThese children may not be identified, the practices to reduce their trauma aren't being supported right now,‚Äù says Ryckman. ‚ÄúEven if they are identified, they may be put in a pipeline where they are going to have to face ongoing interviews about their trauma or face their traffickers again.‚Äù LWOB has, along with partner organizations, identified around 200 victims of human trafficking in Tanzania, with the majority referred to safe houses, says Lulu Makwale, a victim service coordinator at Lawyers Without Borders. ‚ÄúMost of the funding for the safe houses has been paused, meaning the services and the needs of the victim are also being paused too,‚Äù Makwale says. She says the organization has been linking up shelters to investigators up until now. ‚ÄúVictims may not be connected well now to the law enforcement,‚Äù Makwale says. As well as supporting victims directly, many of the efforts also provide training or technical assistance to police forces, allowing them to better investigate crimes. One program listed on the  State Department‚Äôs list of counter-trafficking  funding says it is providing training to combat online child sexual exploitation for 10,000 police officers, prosecutors, and judges in 100 countries. The person with links to work in a European country says their organization has 74 investigations into traffickers ongoing, plus 66 prosecutions that are underway. They say that the funding changes will have a ‚Äúsignificant and negative impact on these criminal trials‚Äù and the safety of people who may give evidence in the cases. Ryckman, from Lawyers Without Borders, says the organization recently completed work on an online database for identifying victims and tracking online child exploitation in Kenya. While the database is functional, Ryckman says, future work to train people has been paused, and there will be a slower uptake of the system. ‚ÄúI do believe it will be used, and it will be extremely useful,‚Äù Ryckman says. ‚ÄúBut these victims are there now. They shouldn‚Äôt have to wait.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-usaid-state-department-child-exploitation/"},

In some cases, any deviations in the manner in which the data is being used may be not only illegal, the ACLU says, but unconstitutional. DOGE operatives have infiltrated or assumed control of a number of federal agencies that are responsible for managing personnel files on nearly 2 million federal employees, as well as offices that supply the government with a broad range of software and information technology services. Unauthorized use of sensitive or personally identifiable data as part of an effort to purge the government of ideologically unaligned staff may constitute a  violation of federal law . The  Privacy Act  and the  Federal Information Security Modernization Act  strictly prohibit, for instance, unauthorized access and use of government personnel data. In a letter to members of several congressional oversight committees, ACLU attorneys highlighted DOGE‚Äôs access to Treasury systems that handle a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of federal payments, which includes details on Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and salaries. Citing WIRED  reporting from Tuesday , the attorneys note that, in addition to choking off funding to specific agencies or individuals, this grants DOGE access to ‚Äútroves of personal information,‚Äù including ‚Äúmillions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances, and personal finances.‚Äù The attorneys write: ‚ÄúAccess to‚Äîand abuse of‚Äîthat information could harm millions of people. Young engineers, with no experience in human resources, governmental benefits, or legal requirements around privacy have gained unprecedented surveillance over payments to federal employees, Social Security recipients, and small businesses‚Äîand with it, control over those payments.‚Äù The ACLU attorneys stress that, under normal circumstances, these systems would fall under the control of career civil servants with years of training and experience in managing sensitive data, all of whom survived a comprehensive vetting process. The group has also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the communications records of identified DOGE personnel, as well as for details of any requests the task force may have made for access to sensitive and personal data at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Other files the ACLU seeks pertain to DOGE‚Äôs plans to deploy artificial intelligence tools across the government, as well as any plans or discussions about how the task force plans to conform to the litany of federal laws safeguarding sensitive financial and medical information, such as the the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). WIRED  first reported Thursday  that DOGE operatives at the General Services Administration, which manages the US government‚Äôs IT infrastructure, had begun pushing to rapidly deploy a homebrew AI chatbot called ‚ÄúGSAi.‚Äù A source with knowledge of GSA's prior dealings with AI tells WIRED that the agency launched a pilot program last fall aimed at testing the use of Gemini, a chatbot adapted for Google Workplace. DOGE quickly determined, however, that Gemini would not provide the level of data desired by the task force. It's unclear whether GSA has assessed the privacy impacts of deploying the GSAi chatbot‚Äîa requirement under federal law. The ACLU tells WIRED it is prepared to pursue all options in obtaining the documents, including lawsuits, if necessary. ‚ÄúThe American people deserve to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized,‚Äù says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of ACLU‚Äôs Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs every indication that DOGE has forced its way into the government‚Äôs most tightly protected databases and systems, without consideration of long-standing privacy safeguards mandated by Congress. We need answers now.‚Äù The ACLU‚Äôs warning was directed at the chairs and ranking members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Financial Services, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance. ‚ÄúPresidential overreach that violates our privacy and attacks funding for critical programs is going to hurt people across the country‚Äîpotentially undermining Social Security, payments to small businesses, and programs that support children and families,‚Äù Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at ACLU, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúCongress must meet its constitutional responsibility and ensure that the president is carrying out the law, not flouting it.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/aclu-doge-congress-musk-data/"},

The cuts largely targeted contractors and so-called probationary employees, workers who have served less than two years at the agency. Sources tell WIRED that the CFPB‚Äôs enforcement division was hit hard, but it‚Äôs unclear how many employees were let go. Workers were informed that they had been fired with a frenetic email delivered around 9 pm ET on Tuesday. An evidently failed mail merge meant that some affected employees were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division]. ‚ÄúThis is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of [Job Title] and federal service consistent with the above references,‚Äù the email from acting chief human capital officer Adam Martinez says. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the Agency finds that that [sic] you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency‚Äôs current needs.‚Äù The firings follow a tumultuous few days at the CFPB. On Friday, staff for Elon Musk‚Äôs  Department of Government Efficiency  shut down a portion of the agency‚Äôs homepage after a day of struggling to obtain access to the CMS and other systems. WIRED reported last week that three DOGE staffers, including Gavin Kliger and Nikhil Rajpal, were given access to the CFPB‚Äôs HR, procurement, and financial infrastructure. The DOGE workers were later granted access to all of the agency‚Äôs systems on Friday,  Bloomberg reported this week , including bank examination and enforcement records. Later on Friday evening, Russell Vought‚ÄîPresident Trump‚Äôs newly confirmed director of the Office of Management and Budget‚Äîtook over as the acting administrator for the CFPB late Friday evening, as first reported by  The Wall Street Journal . Soon after, DOGE staff began sending out email requests asking CFPB managers to give Kliger additional access to agency systems, including physical access control system, payroll processing systems, and the ability to edit the CFPB‚Äôs website, sources tell WIRED. Just before 10:30 pm ET on Friday, sources say, someone who appeared to have administrative privileges accessed the agency server using Secure Shell, a protocol that allows remote control of a computer over a network. Bypassing the content management system, they unpublished the homepage file, causing a portion of the CFPB homepage to display a ‚Äú404: Page not found‚Äù notice typical of a website that has been deleted or is otherwise missing. The remainder of the site was functional, including submission forms for industry whistleblowers and consumer complaints. Around 11 pm on Friday, the CFPB‚Äôs X account disappeared, and shortly after, according to a CFPB staffer, DOGE left the building. CFPB sources who spoke to WIRED described being blindsided by the DOGE staffers. \"They said they would follow protocol but repeatedly did not,\" one says, noting that the level of access these staffers have could allow them to lock others out of the building, take down the website, and ‚Äúobstruct the bureau‚Äôs ability to carry out its mandate.‚Äù Got a Tip?

One source at CFPB on Friday says they saw two young DOGE staffers wandering through the halls of the building trying to open doors. ‚ÄúDOGE pulled a Darth Vader in cloud city where they came in promising to respect our rules and ask for read access and then tonight [Friday] at 6 they took a heel turn and demanded website access,‚Äù another CFPB source told WIRED at the time. In a pair of emails sent Saturday and Monday, Vought effectively ordered all work at the agency to stop, freezing various enforcement efforts and work on  regulations that would affect payment programs run by Big Tech companies . The CFPB has long been a target of both Elon Musk and conservatives more broadly; the Project 2025 chapter on financial regulatory agencies describes it as ‚Äúa highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency‚Äù and calls to have it abolished. Musk wrote ‚ÄúRIP CFPB‚Äù with a gravestone emoji in an X post Friday afternoon. In November, he posted ‚ÄúDelete CFPB.‚Äù There are around 1,700 employees in  total  at the agency. The CFPB was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that imposed significant regulatory reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Its remit is to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive financial practices, and the agency  claims to be  responsible for $19.7 billion in consumer relief since its inception, as well as $5 billion in civil penalties. Some of those wins have come against payment processors including Block, which last month was  ordered  to pay $175 million in penalties for allegedly failing to sufficiently protect users of its Cash App from fraud. The CFPB also has an active  lawsuit  against JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo for similar alleged failures on their shared payment app Zelle.

The plaintiffs are asking the court for an injunction to cut off DOGE‚Äôs access to information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which functions as the HR department of the United States and houses data on federal workers such as their Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and personnel files. WIRED  previously reported  that Musk and people with connections to him had taken over OPM. ‚ÄúOPM defendants gave DOGE defendants and DOGE‚Äôs agents‚Äîmany of whom are under the age of 25 and are or were until recently employees of Musk‚Äôs private companies‚Äî‚Äòadministrative‚Äô access to OPM computer systems, without undergoing any normal, rigorous national-security vetting,‚Äù the complaint alleges. The plaintiffs accuse DOGE of violating the Privacy Act, a 1974 law that determines how the government can collect, use, and store personal information. Elon Musk, the DOGE organization, the Office of Personnel Management, and the OPM‚Äôs acting director Charles Ezell are named as defendants in the case. The plaintiffs include over a hundred individual federal workers from across the US government as well as groups that represent them, including AFL-CIO, a coalition of labor unions, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the Association of Administrative Law Judges. The AFGE represents over 800,000 federal workers ranging from Social Security Administration employees to border patrol agents. The plaintiffs are represented by prominent tech industry lawyers, including counsel from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, as well as Mark Lemley, an intellectual property and tech lawyer who recently  dropped Meta  as a client in its contentious AI copyright lawsuit because he objected to what he alleges is the company‚Äôs embrace of ‚Äúneo-Nazi madness.‚Äù ‚ÄúDOGE's unlawful access to employee records turns out to be the means by which they are trying to accomplish a number of other illegal ends. It is how they got a list of all government employees to make their illegal buyout offer, for instance. It gives them access to information about transgender employees so they can illegally discriminate against those employees. And it lays the groundwork for the illegal firings we have seen across multiple departments,‚Äù Lemley told WIRED. EFF lawyer Victoria Noble says there are heightened concerns about DOGE‚Äôs data access because of the political nature of Musk‚Äôs project. For example, Noble says, there‚Äôs a risk that Musk and his acolytes may use OPM data to target ideological opponents or ‚Äúpeople they see as disloyal.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere's significant risk that this information could be used to identify employees to essentially terminate based on improper considerations,‚Äù Noble told WIRED. ‚ÄúThere's medical information, there's disability information, there's information about people's involvement with unions.‚Äù The Office of Personnel Management and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The team behind the lawsuit plans to push even further. ‚ÄúThis is just phase one, focused on getting an injunction to stop the continuing violation of the law,‚Äù says Lemley. The next phase will include filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of impacted federal workers. ‚ÄúAny current or former federal employee who spends or loses even a small amount of money responding to the data breach, for example, by purchasing credit monitoring services, is entitled to a minimum of $1000 in statutory damages,‚Äù Lemley says. The complaint specifies that the plaintiffs have already paid for credit monitoring and web monitoring services to protect themselves against DOGE potentially mishandling their data. The lawsuit is part of a flurry of complaints filed in recent days opposing various executive orders signed by Trump as well as activities conducted by DOGE, which has dispatched a cadre of Musk loyalists to radically overhaul and sometimes  effectively dismantle  various government agencies. An earlier lawsuit  filed against the Office of Personnel Management  on January 27 alleges that DOGE was operating an illegal server at OPM. On Monday, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy-focused nonprofit, brought its own  lawsuit  against OPM, the US Department of the Treasury, and DOGE, alleging ‚Äúthe largest and most consequential data breach in US history.‚Äù Filed in a US District Court in Virginia, it also called for an injunction to halt DOGE‚Äôs access to sensitive data. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has similarly  characterized DOGE‚Äôs data access  as potentially illegal in a letter to members of Congress sent last week. The courts have already taken some limited actions to curb DOGE‚Äôs campaign. On Saturday, a federal judge  blocked Musk‚Äôs lieutenants from accessing Treasury Department records  that contained sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers. The Trump Administration is already aggressively pushing back,  calling  the order ‚Äúunprecedented judicial interference.‚Äù Today, President Trump  reportedly prepared  to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to work with DOGE.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/government-employees-lawsuit-privacy-doge/"},

The report argues that the so-called indirect research costs targeted by the cuts contribute to the ‚Äúmassive growth in DEI staff at US universities.‚Äù The NIH policy change, announced on  February 7 , dramatically reduces the amount of funding that accompanies NIH grants to cover indirect costs‚Äîmoney that universities put toward building maintenance, administration, support staff wages, regulatory compliance, and safety requirements associated with funded research. The cuts, which standardize indirect costs at 15 percent of the grant size, will be potentially devastating for research universities that are heavily dependent on federal grants. Many universities directly negotiate these rates, which historically average 27 to 28 percent, with some universities receiving over 60 percent. Stanford University alone is facing a reduction of  $160 million , with many other research universities facing reductions in the tens or  hundreds of millions of dollars . The wider economies of university cities will also be hit, as indirect research costs are used to pay laborers, administrators, janitors, technicians, and other support staff. All of this comes on top of the deep cuts Elon Musk‚Äôs  Department of Government Efficiency  have inflicted across  government departments . In the notice announcing the change, the NIH argued that private foundations provide much lower rates of indirect costs than the federal government. To make that argument, the NIH notice draws heavily on what appears to be an analysis from a  2022 report  from the Heritage Foundation called ‚ÄúIndirect Costs: How Taxpayers Subsidize University Nonsense.‚Äù The authors of that report, Jay Greene and John Schoof, claim that indirect costs have been used to ‚Äúsubsidize the agenda of the political left‚Äù and fund DEI staff on university campuses. Reducing indirect costs, the authors allege, would ‚Äúdramatically reduce the amount of money available to spend on political activism‚Äù as well as ‚Äúuniversities‚Äô ability to install more DEI staff.‚Äù The report claims that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal indirect cost rate is associated with 2.1 additional DEI employees, while a $100 million increase in the total amount of indirect costs received by a university is associated with 15.5 additional DEI employees. ‚ÄúCurrently, taxpayers are forced to subsidize the agenda of the political left through funding its research agendas and DEI staff on university campuses,‚Äù the authors of the 2022 report wrote. ‚ÄúThe Left has used the indirect cost reimbursement system to capture an important professional institution.\" The NIH notice does not mention DEI, and the Heritage Foundation report does not recommend a 15 percent cap specifically. But the federal agency justifies its slashed rate in part by citing a ‚Äúrecent analysis‚Äù that found that 67 out of 72 universities were willing to accept research grants with no indirect cost coverage. While the notice does not provide a source for that analysis, it appears to have originated in the Heritage Foundation report. The 2022 report includes an analysis of 82 universities, the indirect cost rate they receive from federal grants, and the indirect cost rate they receive from private funders such as the Sloan Foundation, Gates Foundation, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Ten of the schools in the Heritage Foundation analysis did not confirm their indirect cost rates for private funders, leaving 72 full entries in the report‚Äôs analysis. Of those 72 universities, the report claimed that 67 accepted private research grants with zero percent indirect research cost coverage‚Äîexactly the same analysis and finding as in the NIH notice. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former NIH employee, or a scientist who has been impacted by this administration? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact our reporters securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45 and emullin.06. The Heritage Foundation report concluded that just three schools in the sample refuse to accept indirect cost rates from private foundations at lower rates than those they negotiated with the federal government. Those schools are the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Massachusetts Institute for Technology, and the University of Michigan. The NIH notice refers to the same three schools without identifying the Heritage Foundation as the source of the analysis. It mentions that Harvard required a minimum 15 percent indirect cost coverage from private funders and that California Institute of Technology required a 20 percent indirect cost coverage. These examples also appear in the Heritage Foundation report. One of the report‚Äôs authors, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Jay Greene, says he was not involved in drafting the NIH notice but did acknowledge that one paragraph of the NIH notice ‚Äúdoes appear to be a reference to our 2022 report.‚Äù The NIH did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comments. A plan to cut indirect cost rates in federal grants also appears in Project 2025, the nearly thousand-page Heritage Foundation policy blueprint for a second Trump presidency. ‚ÄúThis market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,‚Äù the report reads. During his presidential campaign, Trump consistently disavowed any links to the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025. On Monday, a  coalition of 22 states  filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the NIH‚Äôs attempt to cut indirect costs. Universities say the cap will hamper their ability to do vital research. ‚ÄúThe discovery of new treatments would slow, opportunities to train the next generation of scientific leaders would shrink, and our nation‚Äôs science and engineering prowess would be severely compromised,‚Äù wrote  Harvard president  Alan Garber in a post on the university‚Äôs website. Some universities stand to lose more than $100 million in federal funding if the new grant cap is maintained. According  to STAT , Weill Cornell Medicine brought in $107 million in indirect costs during 2022‚Äîa figure that would drop to $23 million if the rate had been 15 percent.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/nih-indirect-funding-cuts-heritage-foundation/"},

WIRED obtained a complete list of GSA buildings, all of which are designated as ‚Äúcore‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù assets. Of the more than 1,500 assets identified on the list, over 900 are designated as ‚Äúcore‚Äù and are thus protected, for now, from sale. The ‚Äúcore‚Äù designation applies to buildings like federal courthouses, border inspection stations, or law enforcement facilities. The GSA, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, plans to sell most of the remaining 500-plus buildings, some of which house government agencies and the offices of US senators. A note on the list of the buildings states that the agency‚Äôs intention is eventually to reduce the ‚Äúsize of the owned real estate footprint by 50 percent and the number of buildings by 70 percent. Reductions will be focused on the non-core general office space of the portfolio which can be replaced as needed in the private leased market. Moving forward, all non-core buildings will be disposed of and their tenants will be transitioned into leases.‚Äù GSA, a  critical government agency  that manages federal buildings and technology, has been staffed with  Elon Musk‚Äôs associates , including X staffer Nicole Hollander, who has high-level agency access and an official government email address. Thomas Shedd, the recently installed director of the Technology Transformation Services within GSA, worked as a software engineer at Tesla for eight years.  WIRED also reported that a number of young engineers  with ties to Musk‚Äôs companies and little to no government experience have been given access to a number of government agencies, including GSA. According to the list, the buildings destined for the block include the  John C. Kluczynski Federal Building  in Chicago, which houses satellite offices for the Department of Labor, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, a probation office, and offices for Democratic Illinois senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. The building also has broader cultural significance‚Äîit was designed by renowned architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and features an iconic Alexander Calder sculpture. The John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston is also listed as a ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù asset. This building, in addition to  housing a number of government agencies , also holds offices for Democratic Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey. The Ed Jones Federal Building in Jackson, Tennessee, which holds an office for Republican senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as Republican congressman David Kustoff, is also listed as a ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù asset. ‚ÄúOptimizing GSA‚Äôs real estate portfolio prioritizes reducing our deferred maintenance liabilities, supporting the return to office of federal employees, and taking advantage of a stronger private/government partnership in managing the workforce of the future,‚Äù reads a press release from GSA issued today. GSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. ‚ÄúThe intention of GSA and the whole federal government is to reduce the number of old buildings that are owned with high liabilities ‚Ä¶ in favor of newer leased buildings, which can be more flexible and are more modern, that have ways for teams to collaborate and have private spaces,‚Äù Shedd told TTS staffers in a meeting on February 5, according to audio obtained by WIRED.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86. Slimming down the federal government‚Äôs real estate portfolio, and the associated maintenance costs, has been a  priority for the agency  since before Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. A number of buildings are in poor repair, underutilized, or ill-suited for modern office layouts. In 2023, the GSA divested a total of five buildings, and identified 23 additional properties for future divestment. Now that target appears to be an order of magnitude higher. The commercial real estate (CRE) market is fragile, though, in the aftermath of Covid and the rise of remote work, which drove down property values. In an op-ed last summer for the Harvard Business Review, one chief economist  warned  that banks with sizable CRE portfolios face exposure due to looming loan obligations and could fail, leading to a financial crisis. Placing hundreds of new buildings on the market, many in already struggling city centers, potentially risks further instability. Many of the federal buildings on the list of non-core real estate are fully occupied, sources tell WIRED. This includes buildings like the Senator Paul Simon Federal Building in Carbondale, Illinois, which houses offices for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Social Security Administration, in addition to offices for Durbin, as well as the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building in Detroit, Michigan, which also houses numerous agencies. The Trump administration has also touted a  return-to-office requiremen t as a key part of its plan‚Äîsomething made more difficult if government employees don‚Äôt have an office to return to. ‚ÄúThe GSA administration has moved quickly to cut regulation, reduce contract spin, and reduce lease square footage faster than any past administration that I‚Äôm personally aware of,‚Äù Shedd said at the February 5 meeting. The Washington Post  reported  that these sales are intended to lower work morale to the point that employees voluntarily leave. Sources confirmed to WIRED that speed does appear to be a priority. ‚ÄúNormally the building disposal process involves a  public notice and response period , allowing local governments or nonprofits a first dibs, so to speak,‚Äù a source at GSA tells WIRED. ‚ÄúGiven the sheer number of potential disposals, it is unclear if GSA intends to follow the process established by law.‚Äù Makena Kelly and Tim Marchman contributed reporting.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/gsa-sell-government-buildings/"},

It‚Äôs been three weeks since Elon Musk‚Äôs agents took over the  government‚Äôs IT  and  HR departments . Since then, the movements of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have had the cartography of a horror movie,  DOGE  picking off agencies one by one based on slasher logic, feeding an unslakeable thirst for cost-cutting and data. Every day brings fresh incursions. Three weeks ago the United States believed in  humanitarian aid . It helped people who had been ripped off by big corporations. It funded the infrastructure necessary to make America a beacon of scientific innovation. Now the  United States Agency for International Development  is gutted, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  is on ice, and  National Institutes of Health  grants are handcuffed. So much for all that. These are spreadsheet cruelties, executed with a click. The loss of real peoples‚Äô jobs and lives‚Äîyes, despite what X-famous conspiracy theorists will tell you,  USAID saved lives ‚Äîall immaterial compared to the pursuit of a tighter balance sheet. Three weeks ago, a 19-year-old who calls himself ‚Äú Big Balls ‚Äù online didn‚Äôt have access to government personnel records and more. A 25-year-old with a closet full of racist tweets hadn‚Äôt gotten the  keys to Treasury systems that pay out $5.45 trillion each year . Elon Musk hadn‚Äôt turned the Oval Office into a romper room for his 4-year-old son. The speed is strategy, of course, flooding the zone so that neither the media nor the courts can keep pace. Lawsuits and court orders move on a different timescale than this slash-and-burn approach. (At this pace, DOGE will have tapped into every last government server long before the Supreme Court even has a chance to weigh in.) But it‚Äôs also reflexive. The first order of business in a corporate takeover is to slash costs as quickly as possible. If you can‚Äôt fire people, offer them buyouts. If they won‚Äôt take the buyouts, find a way to fire them anyway. Keep cutting until you hit bone. This is how you get an  executive order  declaring that ‚Äúeach agency hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart,‚Äù an arbitrary ratio with no regard for actual staffing needs. It‚Äôs how you get  hundreds of federal government buildings on the auction block  no matter how fully occupied they are. It‚Äôs both extreme and ill-considered, a race to empty the town‚Äôs only well. And then ‚Ä¶ what? This is the question that Elon Musk and DOGE have failed to answer, because there is no answer. Does the United States government need to become a profit engine? To return shareholder value? Does Medicaid need to demonstrate a product-market fit in time for the next funding round? This is consultant logic. This is an engineering sprint whose inevitable finish line is the unwinding of the social contract. Democracy doesn‚Äôt die in darkness after all; it dies in JIRA tickets filed by  Palantir alums . It‚Äôs somehow even worse than that, though. Suppose you take this whole enterprise at face value, that the United States should go through the  private equity ringer . It does not take a Stanford MBA to know that cutting expenses only helps half of your profit and loss statement. Any serious attempt to treat the US like a business would involve increasing revenues. So where are the taxes? And why demolish the CFPB, which has paid out over  $20 billion to US citizens ‚Äîshareholders, if you will‚Äîthrough its enforcement actions? In the coming weeks and months, as this farce continues to unfurl, remember that the goal of most acquisitions is not to benefit the acquired. It is to either subsume or discard, whichever generates the highest return. Elon Musk‚Äôs unprecedented influence over the executive branch will ultimately benefit Elon Musk. The employees in charge are  his employees . The data DOGE collects, the procurement contracts they oversee, it all flows up to him. And it‚Äôs flowing too quickly to keep up with, much less to stop.

The sudden cuts seemingly targeted probationary and short-term staffers, including workers supplied by the Presidential Innovation Fellowship program, which brings skilled technologists from the private sector to work in government for a few years at a time. Around 50 of the 70 members of the US Digital Corps, an early-career, two-year government fellowship, were terminated as well, sources say. Sources also tell WIRED that TTS management met with workers individually prior to the terminations, giving them one last chance to take the deferred resignation offered in the ‚ÄúFork in the Road‚Äù email from  late last month . One TTS staffer called the meetings ‚Äúcoercive for sure.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear how many people are being let go, but multiple sources tell WIRED that list could be upwards of 70 if not more. Prior, there were around 650 TTS employees. Fired staffers are expected to receive a formal termination email later Wednesday evening. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning of this administration, GSA‚Äòs leadership has been committed to supporting the administration's initiatives to rightsize the federal workforce. GSA has taken immediate action to fully implement all current executive orders and is committed to taking action to implement any new executive orders,‚Äù a GSA spokesperson tells WIRED. ‚ÄúLike all agencies, GSA has been working to meet OPM [Office of Personnel Management] memo requirements as it relates to probationary periods. GSA has been and remains committed to ensuring a respectful and dignified process for our agency personnel during this transformation.‚Äù Terminated employees‚Äô last day is expected to be March 7, sources say. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Similar firings took place at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  on Tuesday evening. Dozens of staffers, primarily probationary ones with fewer than two years of service, received termination emails. Due to what appeared to be a failed mail merge, fired workers were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division]. When Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla software engineer, joined TTS, he told staff to expect workforce cuts. ‚ÄúWe should expect that GSA will be operating with a significantly smaller budget and significantly reduced staff in future,‚Äù Shedd told TTS staffers in an all-hands meeting last week in audio obtained by WIRED. GSA‚Äôs vision for the TTS, under new leadership, is an agency that runs like a ‚Äústartup software company,‚Äù  WIRED reported last week , focusing on AI, automating different internal processes, and centralizing data from across the federal government. GSA was one of the first agencies  Musk associates  took over once President Donald Trump returned to power. Nicole Hollander, who aided Musk in his Twitter acquisition, has joined the upper levels of GSA, along with a slew of other  young technologists  associated with Musk companies. The reductions in head count come as Shedd and TTS leadership are hoping to launch ‚ÄúGSAi,‚Äù a custom generative AI chatbot, within the next few weeks.  WIRED recently reported  that the goal of this initiative is to increase productivity among staff and to analyze massive amounts of data. The agency is also planning to sell  more than 500 federal buildings  to cut overall costs, while pushing for employees to return to in-person office work. On Wednesday evening,  a federal judge allowed the Trump administration  to continue with its plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce.

At the time of his comment, the  DOGE website was empty . However, when the site finally came online Thursday morning, it turned out to be little more than a glorified feed of posts from the official DOGE account on Musk‚Äôs own X platform, raising new questions about Musk‚Äôs  conflicts of interest in running DOGE . DOGE.gov claims to be an ‚Äúofficial website of the United States government,‚Äù but rather than giving detailed breakdowns of the cost savings and efficiencies Musk claims his project is making, the homepage of the site just replicated posts from the DOGE account on X. A WIRED review of the page‚Äôs source code shows that the promotion of Musk‚Äôs own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the site‚Äôs  canonical tags  direct search engines to x.com rather than DOGE.gov. A canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted. In DOGE‚Äôs case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on DOGE.gov, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X. ‚ÄúIt is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,‚Äù Declan Chidlow,  a web developer , tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThis isn't usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.‚Äù All the other US government websites WIRED checked used their own homepage in their canonical tags, including the official White House website. Additionally, when sharing the DOGE website on mobile devices, the source code creates a link to the DOGE X account rather than the website itself. ‚ÄúIt seems that the DOGE website is secondary, and they are prodding people in the direction of the X account everywhere they can,‚Äù Chidlow adds. Alongside the homepage feed of X posts, a section of Doge.gov labeled ‚ÄúSavings‚Äù now appears. So far the page is empty except for a single line that reads: ‚ÄúReceipts coming soon, no later than Valentine's day,‚Äù followed by  a heart emoji . A section entitled ‚ÄúWorkforce‚Äù features some bar charts showing how many people work in each government agency, with the information coming from data gathered by the Office of Personnel Management in March 2024. A disclaimer at the bottom of the page reads: ‚ÄúThis is DOGE's effort to create a comprehensive, government-wide org chart. This is an enormous effort, and there are likely some errors or omissions. We will continue to strive for maximum accuracy over time.‚Äù Another section, entitled ‚ÄúRegulations,‚Äù features what DOGE calls the ‚ÄúUnconstitutionality Index,‚Äù which it describes as ‚Äúthe number of agency rules created by unelected bureaucrats for each law passed by Congress in 2024.‚Äù The charts in this section are also based on data previously collected by US government agencies. Doge.gov also links to a Forbes article from last month that was written by Clyde Wayne Crews, a member of the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that pushed  climate change disinformation  and questioned the  links between tobacco and lung cancer . It is also a major advocate for  privatizing government departments . The site also features a ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù page which allows prospective DOGE employees to apply for roles including ‚Äúsoftware engineers, InfoSec engineers, and other technology professionals.‚Äù As well as requesting a Github account and r√©sum√©, the form asks visitors to ‚Äúprovide 2-3 bullet points showcasing exceptional ability.‚Äù The website does not list a developer, but on Wednesday, web application security expert Sam Curry  outlined in a thread on X  how he was able to identify the developer of the site as DOGE employee Kyle Shutt. Curry claims he was able to link a Cloudflare account ID found in the site‚Äôs source code to Shutt, who used the same account when developing  Musk‚Äôs America PAC  website. On Thursday,  Drop Site News  reported, citing sources within FEMA, that Shutt had gained access to the agency‚Äôs proprietary software controlling payments. Earlier this week,  Business Insider reported  that Shutt, who recently worked at an AI interviewing software company, was listed as one of 30 people working for DOGE. Neither Shutt, DOGE, nor the White House responded to requests for comment.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-website-is-just-one-big-x-ad/"},

Though it had been  previously reported  that Krause, who had been called a special government employee, had obtained Lebryk‚Äôs old position, the email also notably states that Krause is ‚Äúcurrently the CEO of Cloud Software Group.‚Äù ‚ÄúTom brings more than 20 years of experience leading, building, and positioning software and technology companies for value and long-term success,‚Äù the email reads. ‚ÄúTom is currently the CEO of Cloud Software Group which manages and operates multiple mission critical enterprise software businesses.‚Äù In response to questions from WIRED, a representative for the company said that ‚ÄúTom is the CEO of Cloud Software Group‚Äù and forwarded a copy of an email sent to the company‚Äôs employees last week in which Krause wrote, ‚Äúin addition to my duties as CEO of Cloud Software Group, I am advising the US Department of Treasury as a ‚Äòspecial government employee.‚Äô I am honored to serve our country.‚Äù Critics believe Krause retaining his job in addition to serving in the government could be a massive  conflict of interest . Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cloud Software Group did not respond to questions about whether Krause would continue to draw a salary from the company during his time with the Treasury. In an affidavit filed Thursday in the  lawsuit   Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury , Krause wrote, ‚ÄúWhile in this Treasury role, I have also maintained my employment as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cloud Software Group, Inc., which [is] a privately held company comprised of several enterprise software businesses. This arrangement has been approved by Treasury‚Äôs ethics office, who determined, based on my role as an SGE, that this arrangement was permissible.\" In the same affidavit, Krause said, ‚ÄúI have not yet assumed those duties\" as Fiscal Assistant Secretary.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at velliott88.18. ‚ÄúI cannot think of another example where this has occurred, but I do think it's part of a broader pattern of the erasure of conflicts of interests within the federal government,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúFederal employees can't take more than a $25 gift from someone who might be trying to influence their actions. On the other hand, their bosses are simultaneously running private companies while also running parts of the government that affect their businesses.‚Äù Treasury in particular, he says, could pose a conflict of interest across industries because ‚Äúit affects everything.‚Äù And any alleged conflicts of interest may not be limited to just Krause‚Äôs own company. ‚ÄúThere is a network of people coming from Silicon Valley and corporate America now that are working together,‚Äù Moynihan says. ‚ÄúAnd so it's not just about the conflict of interest he might have with his business, but the way in which he's situated to help that broader network that are now effectively running the government.‚Äù Although Treasury and White House officials have gone  back  and  forth  about DOGE‚Äôs access to Treasury payment systems,  WIRED has reported  that, at one point, DOGE had both read and write access.  Marko Elez , one of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are associated with DOGE, was granted read and write privileges on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the BFS, an agency that, according to Treasury records, paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. (An affidavit filed in the same  Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury  lawsuit by a Bureau of the Fiscal Service official claims Elez only had read and write access to the SPS.) A federal judge last week granted an order to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and changing Treasury payment system information, following a lawsuit alleging that the Treasury Department provided ‚ÄúElon Musk or other individuals associated with DOGE‚Äù access to the payment systems and that this access violated federal privacy laws. The order, however, specifically provided a carve-out for Krause and Elez, though their access was supposed to be restricted to ‚Äú read only .‚Äù A subsequent order  blocked  DOGE members from access to payment systems. In response to the Trump administration‚Äôs objections that the order would block people with legitimate need to access systems, such as the Treasury secretary and contractors, the order was loosened to note that ‚Äúthe Secretary of the Treasury and other Senate-confirmed senior Treasury Officers are not prohibited from accessing Treasury's payment systems.‚Äù This would appear to leave Krause barred from access to the very systems the Fiscal Assistant Secretary oversees. Last week, the threat intelligence team at one of the Treasury‚Äôs agencies recommended that DOGE members be  monitored as an ‚Äúinsider threat,‚Äù  WIRED reported. An internal email sent to the BFS‚Äôs IT division and others called DOGE staff‚Äôs access to federal payments systems ‚Äúthe single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are running out of ways to say ‚Äòunprecedented,‚Äô‚Äù says Moynihan. Earlier today, the Office of the Inspector General at the Treasury  said  it would be auditing the government‚Äôs payment systems in response to concerns raised by Democratic senators about DOGE‚Äôs access. It will also be examining the past two years of payments to evaluate whether any have been fraudulent, which  Musk has alleged .

After hearing some two hours of arguments, Judge Jeannette A. Vargas told lawyers for New York and allied states, and their opponents from the Department of Justice, ‚ÄúI do find good cause to extend the TRO as modified.‚Äù Vargas said she would soon issue her decision, but not today, to ‚Äúgive the court time to consider‚Äù the issues. While the proceeding largely maintained the status quo, it also lifted the veil on just how little is known about DOGE‚Äôs access to information‚Äîand where it went. When Vargas asked Jeffrey Oestericher, the Justice Department attorney representing Trump, on Friday whether any DOGE-accessed information had been shared outside of the Treasury Department, he said: ‚ÄúThe short answer on that is we don‚Äôt presently know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre performing a forensic analysis. What we can tell from the forensic analysis thus far is there were emails sent outside Treasury,‚Äù Oestericher said. ‚ÄúWe do not know [the] content.‚Äù Vargas asked: Wasn‚Äôt this problematic from a privacy standpoint? ‚ÄúThe short answer is no,‚Äù Oestericher said. ‚ÄúDuring this time that the DOGE team members had access to this information, there were extensive mitigation efforts in place to prevent this precise harm.‚Äù But Oestericher admitted at another point, ‚ÄúWe candidly admit that there was some measure of increased risk, but we took all appropriate mitigation measures to mitigate that risk as much as possible.‚Äù Vargas‚Äô decision came six days after New York and allied litigants were granted a temporary restraining order that ultimately prohibited the Treasury Department from giving DOGE hires and special government employees access to sensitive data and computer systems. Donald Trump tapped Elon Musk to head  DOGE , an agency the president created under the auspices of rooting out fraud and governmental waste‚Äîdespite a  dearth of evidence  indicating fraud. In issuing that temporary restraining order early February 8, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said that the states suing Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would ‚Äúface irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.‚Äù Engelmayer noted that Treasury‚Äôs new policy, enacted at Trump‚Äôs direction, appears to allegedly ‚Äú[expand] access to the paytment systems of the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) to political appointees and ‚Äòspecial government employees.‚Äô‚Äù This, Engelmayer reasoned, represented a ‚Äúrisk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.‚Äù Engelmayer also said in his written decision that the states suing over Treasury‚Äôs policy change ‚Äúhave shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, with the States‚Äô statutory claims presenting as particularly strong.‚Äù The complaint against Trump and Bessent repeatedly cited WIRED‚Äôs  reporting  that revealed how a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, with ties to Musk, enjoyed read and write access to two Treasury Department systems responsible for virtually all payments made by the federal government. Tom Krause‚Äîwho is on the DOGE team  despite being CEO of Cloud Software Group ‚Äîwas also granted access to these capabilities. Two sources told WIRED that Elez‚Äôs privileges allowed him not just to read but also write code for two of the most sensitive US government computer systems. These include the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). These systems, which are kept on a secure mainframe,  control government payments  that total more than 20 percent of the US economy, WIRED previously reported. In court papers filed February 13, New York and allies allege that Trump and his Treasury Department don‚Äôt even contest that states have a ‚Äúclear and reasonable interest in protecting their confidential bank account numbers and other sensitive financial information, including details and amounts of payments, from unauthorized disclosure.‚Äù But this information was disclosed to two DOGE members, they claim, violating ‚Äúnumerous laws and regulations.‚Äù New York and other states argued in that same filing that BFS‚Äôs development of ‚Äúmitigation strategies‚Äù to reduce risk was testament to the ‚Äúsubstantial and imminent‚Äù danger. They say that at least on one occasion, Elez was ‚Äúmistakenly provided with ‚Äòread/write permissions instead of read-only.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúBut even with the more restricted ‚Äòread-only‚Äô access, Elez still had ‚Äòthe ability to view and query information and data‚Äô; in other words, he had access to the States‚Äô sensitive financial information.‚Äù Despite the fact that Elez resigned when  asked for comment  by The Wall Street Journal about racist social media posts, the government didn‚Äôt provide any reassurance that he didn‚Äôt participate in improper activity, New York and its allies alleged. (Meanwhile, Musk  suggested  in a post on X, his social media platform, that Elez would be rehired, writing: ‚ÄúHe will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.‚Äù) Andrew Amer, an attorney in New York state attorney general Letitia James‚Äô office, said Friday that Elez and Krause ‚Äúhave no lawful job duty to access this information.‚Äù Despite the government‚Äôs insistence that Elez was in a ‚Äúsandbox environment‚Äù when he had access to the code, which they insist minimized risk, Amer said that wasn‚Äôt all that comforting. ‚ÄúWe know that the same engineer took screenshots of the data in the data system and that he may have given those screenshots to his supervisor,‚Äù Amer said. Amer said the Justice Department‚Äôs insistence that Krause only had ‚Äúover-the-shoulder access‚Äù didn‚Äôt inspire much confidence either. ‚ÄúThe fact that we don‚Äôt know if any information went beyond Treasury is a red flag that causes concern about the ethics issue,‚Äù Amer said. ‚ÄúThis is especially important, as we do have people, especially Mr. Krause, who is simultaneously employed elsewhere outside Treasury.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have somebody who‚Äôs been given access to source code within the bureau whose other job is CEO of one of the world‚Äôs largest software companies.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are here because the states‚Äô banking information has been accessed‚Äî that has happened,‚Äù Amer said at another point in court. ‚ÄúWe know that the people who accessed it have been somewhat careless in the way they handled it.‚Äù Amer also rejected any notion that DOGE acolytes‚Äô access was normal. ‚ÄúThis was not a Treasury function, this was building a new automated process to apply an ideological litmus test to funding requests. There‚Äôs nothing typical or normal in terms of Treasure functions about that.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs camp has contended that his opponents are trying to thwart the White House‚Äôs right ‚Äúto exercise politically accountable oversight of agency activities and to implement the president‚Äôs policy priorities.‚Äù Treasury Department officials are responsible for liaising with the United States DOGE Service, which needs to have access to BFS systems, they argue, ‚Äúto perform their Presidentially-directed mandate of maximizing efficiency and productivity, including ensuring data and payment integrity with respect to the 1.2 billion transactions and over $5 trillion in outlays handled by BFS,‚Äù they said in court papers. Red states including Florida, Georgia, and Alabama have also entered the fray to show support for Trump. They contend in court papers that blue states‚Äô opposition to DOGE meddling is unconstitutional. ‚ÄúThis case involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers and the President‚Äôs authority under Article II of the Constitution,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúUltimately, Plaintiffs here are upset because one set of bureaucrats in the Executive Branch have access to data that they believe only other bureaucrats in the Executive Branch should have access to.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis type of fiddling around with the President‚Äôs prerogatives asks this Court to insert itself into core Executive decision-making regarding policy and personnel. The President is working to combat what former President Biden‚Äôs administration identified, at minimum, as hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud,‚Äù they wrote.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-treasury-department-data-access-denied/"},

The terminated workers, who were told their employment would end at 5 pm EST today, included those still under probation, but also workers who had already completed the requisite one-year probationary period to become permanent workers and at-will workers who were considered permanent employees. Earlier this month, however, these permanent workers were suddenly told by NSF that their one-year probationary period should have been two years and they were no longer safe from being terminated. The Trump administration has ordered federal agencies to  fire nearly all   probationary employees  who had not yet gained permanent status, thereby receiving civil service protections. But NSF workers who believed they were safe suddenly found themselves without jobs today. The National Science Foundation is an independent agency within the federal government that provides grants to universities and other bodies in support of scientific and engineering research. The foundation‚Äôs grants account for about a quarter of all federal support to academic institutions for research. NSF‚Äôs grants were paused in late January due to a funding freeze, but the agency  resumed issuing grants  following a court order early this month. Many of the people terminated on Tuesday work as program managers and experts who make decisions about funding by aligning research proposals with the right program and matching those proposals to the most qualified reviewers to assess them and make recommendations. ‚ÄúIt is hard to imagine this being accomplished successfully with automated algorithms,‚Äù one fired program manager told WIRED. ‚ÄúWith fewer program officers to steward the evaluation process, the overwhelming concern is that it will become harder to identify and support the transformative but unconventional projects that could otherwise be game changers in terms of advancing scientific progress in the USA.‚Äù All sources who spoke with WIRED requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Sources say 168 workers received an email at 9:02 am EST this morning requesting their presence at a 10 am Zoom call for a ‚ÄúMeeting with NSF probationary employees.‚Äù Many workers did not receive the Zoom link, however, and missed the start of the call. At the meeting, they were told that their network access would be shut out at 1 pm and they had until 5 pm to clear out their desks, though workers were told that accommodations would be made to obtain things they weren‚Äôt able to clear out by 5 pm. The termination action this morning also included all permanent employees who were designated as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù workers. One terminated worker tells WIRED that they were a permanent federal employee working on a part-time basis, with an annual contract that was up for renewal in September. The decision to terminate at-will employees came from NSF alone, not from the administration, NSF management told workers during the meeting. When asked whether at-will employees were just terminated out of fairness to the probationary workers, NSF management replied that the decision was ‚Äúpartly due to fairness, but that‚Äôs not all.‚Äù The source says management then indicated that this was just the first step in subsequent termination rounds. The worker said they understood from this that the NSF believed at-will workers would be targeted in a subsequent round anyway, so they decided to terminate those workers now as well. The fired program manager who spoke with WIRED came to NSF from academia on a temporary rotation position. Rotationary workers are those who work for a university but spend some of their time working for the NSF for a specific period. When a permanent position suddenly opened up during the worker‚Äôs rotation, NSF asked the worker to apply for it. They were hired in the summer of 2023 as a program manager, with a one-year trial period that ended in the summer of 2024. Paperwork that the worker shared with WIRED showed that the worker became a permanent employee at that time. But the worker says they and others were suddenly told recently that NSF had made a mistake. During the Tuesday Zoom call, the worker says, staff from NSF human resources seemed to indicate they had been caught off guard by the decision. ‚ÄúThey were watching their words carefully,‚Äù the worker says. ‚ÄúMy sense is that they were caught unawares and probably somebody pointed to some federal statute somewhere that made them rethink how they had been doing things in the past.‚Äù The program manager says management and HR personnel told workers on the call that they believed the foundation had discretion to decide the probationary period but were recently told that the foundation did not have that discretion and that the probationary period should have been two years for all workers. Not everyone still on that probationary period got fired on Tuesday. The source tells WIRED that some workers who were very close to completing two years were not included in the terminations today. But workers were told that today‚Äôs action was just the first in what will be other termination actions at the foundation. ‚ÄúThere were exceptions made for people who were very close to completing their two-year period,‚Äù the worker says. The temporary rotation worker and other workers at NSF were told in January that they could accept the so-called fork-in-the-road resignation deal that would allow them to continue to draw a salary through September if they resigned their positions, but the worker says that because he had completed his probationary period he believed his job was safe. Once they were told that the probationary period was in question, he says, he had only a couple of days to decide about the buyout, but the union had advised workers to not take it. Now he says his life and the lives of other workers have been thrown into chaos. The at-will worker says that during a question-and-answer portion of the Zoom call, several workers brought up the fact that federal agencies were supposed to condition the terminations based on merit, but this didn‚Äôt seem to be happening. Workers have been receiving termination letters from the Office of Personnel Management saying that the government has determined they or their position no longer has value to the government. ‚ÄúThere were a number of employees who commented that they had nothing but exemplary performance reviews and director awards for meritorious services, so this notion that they were being let go [for poor performance] was ludicrous,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThe answer was that they were simply copying the verbiage from OPM and that their value to the nation is no longer required.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/national-science-foundation-february-2025-firings/"},

But according to a new court filing from the White House, the administrator of DOGE isn‚Äôt  Elon Musk  after all. Who is? No one knows. The White House won‚Äôt tell the public, an administration lawyer has reportedly  said  he had no idea, and even people who work for the US DOGE Service can‚Äôt get a straight answer. On Monday evening, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House Office of Administration, claimed Musk wasn‚Äôt actually in charge of the  so-called department  he has championed for months. Fisher issued a sworn statement in a lawsuit brought by the state of New Mexico and 13 other Democratic attorneys general accusing Musk of exercising authority beyond the scope of his role. Rather than serving as the DOGE administrator or an employee of DOGE at all, Fisher said, Musk‚Äôs formal role is ‚Äúsenior advisor‚Äù to the president with ‚Äúno greater authority than other senior White House advisors.‚Äù This could make Musk‚Äôs authority and standing at USDS legally murky‚Äîespecially as a  number of lawsuits  embroil the organization‚Äôs activities. The statement has also compounded confusion at USDS, formerly called the US Digital Service and  rebranded as the US DOGE Service  on January 20. Multiple legacy USDS employees tell WIRED they have no idea who the acting administrator is, despite requesting their identity multiple times. Musk  announced that he would lead DOGE  shortly after Trump won the presidential election last year and has spent the weeks since Trump took office championing DOGE‚Äôs work on X, the media platform that he owns, and spreading  misinformation  about the role and expenditures of numerous government agencies targeted by DOGE. In a recent  Oval Office appearance , Trump referred to DOGE as Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúteam.‚Äù If Musk is not serving as the administrator, his leadership appears to be unofficial and in name only. But this would leave it unclear who the official administrator actually is‚Äîor whether the office is vacant. This isn‚Äôt a trivial matter. The executive order establishing DOGE plainly states, ‚ÄúThere shall be a USDS Administrator established in the Executive Office of the President who shall report to the White House Chief of Staff.‚Äù It goes on to say that an organization called the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization will be set up within the USDS, to be headed by the administrator and ‚Äúdedicated to advancing the President‚Äôs 18-month DOGE agenda.‚Äù According to Fisher‚Äôs statement, Musk has nothing to do with any of this. ‚ÄúThe U.S. DOGE Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The U.S. DOGE service Temporary Organization is within the U.S. DOGE Service. Both are separate from the White House Office,‚Äù Fisher wrote in his statement. ‚ÄúMr. Musk is an employee in the White House Office. He is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization. Mr. Musk is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator.‚Äù Before Trump was inaugurated, the USDS administrator was Mina Hsiang. After she left, Ted Carstensen was the highest-ranking legacy USDS leader, but  he resigned from the organization  on February 6. ‚ÄúAfter Ted resigned, we received no correspondence as far as who the head of this organization was,‚Äù says a current USDS employee, who requested anonymity due to concerns of retaliation. Some people WIRED spoke with at USDS view Amy Gleason, a former USDS official who served in the first Trump administration, as a liaison between legacy USDS, DOGE, and other agencies, but little is known about her official role. Steve Davis, a longtime Musk associate and the president of the Boring Company, is another name rumored to be formally leading DOGE. Davis has worked with Musk for years, and led the billionaire‚Äôs cost-cutting efforts when taking over Twitter, now X, in 2022. Davis went as far as  sleeping in the Twitter HQ  with his wife, Nicole Hollander, and their child. (Hollander is now a high-level General Services Administration official.) ‚ÄúSteve Davis has always been articulated as the leader of DOGE, but when I ask if he‚Äôs the administrator, [managers] say we don't know,‚Äù one former USDS employee tells WIRED. ‚ÄúWhen I ask if he‚Äôs the interim administrator, they say ‚Äòwe don't know.‚Äô They've said Brad Smith [a health care entrepreneur with ties to Davis] is serving in a chief of staff role.‚Äù Got a Tip?

Meanwhile, as USDS staffers are trying to figure out who is running their agency, dozens of them have been laid off. Around 50 people out of USDS‚Äôs approximately 200 employees were fired on Friday. Sources tell WIRED that product managers, designers, and members of the talent team were hit the hardest, along with some engineers. ‚ÄúNo rhyme or reason. Literally in the middle of work,‚Äù another source said of the Friday night firings. ‚ÄúThere are so many of us.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have heard that our directors at USDS (legacy) still have not received any kind of list or justification for the intention to terminate emails sent Friday evening,‚Äù says another source at the agency. Last week, multiple agencies were rocked by sudden layoffs. Dozens of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees were fired  after receiving emails botching their names and roles . Later in the week, the entire CFPB team tasked with investigating big tech were terminated, a former CFPB official told WIRED. After the CFPB firings, other agencies, including the General Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, terminated thousands of workers. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment. While Musk‚Äôs DOGE workers have taken over at USDS for the last month, very few legacy employees have interacted with their new colleagues whatsoever. Earlier this month, WIRED reported that DOGE had built a  ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù  separating Musk‚Äôs team from the rest of the organization‚Äôs workforce. The only time legacy staff had a meeting with a representative from DOGE was  on February 1 with Stephanie Holmes , who identified herself as the team‚Äôs new HR person. The only other experiences legacy USDS staff have had with DOGE staff were  their surprise one-on-one interviews  with DOGE-affiliated engineers who refused to identify themselves during the first week of the Trump administration.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-leadership-administrator/"},

In the month since the Trump administration began its purge of federal workers, opponents fighting DOGE in court have been pinning their hopes of stopping the world‚Äôs richest man on a 50-year-old law. In just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed  federal employee records  at the Office of Personnel Management,  government payment data  at the Department of the Treasury,  data on student loan recipients  at the Department of Education,  information on disaster victims  at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and vast amounts of  employment- and workplace-related data  at the Department of Labor. White House staffers are even pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to grant DOGE access to  US taxpayer records . The acting head of the Social Security Administration  recently resigned  rather than give DOGE access to her agency‚Äôs reams of sensitive personal data. More than half a dozen lawsuits are seeking to block DOGE employees from rifling through these vast troves of data. One thing they all have in common: They allege that DOGE‚Äôs actions violate the Privacy Act of 1974. Here‚Äôs how a law passed after Watergate could rein in another president whose self-professed zeal for retribution is unnerving constitutional experts. What Is the Privacy Act? The Privacy Act  is a law that limits how the federal government can collect, use, and share information about US citizens and other people in the United States. The law‚Äôs core features include letting people  access government records about them ; letting people  correct those records  if they contain mistakes;  requiring agencies  to limit information collection, publish lists of records databases, and protect data from hackers; and  restricting how agency employees and third parties  can access records. Those restrictions on accessing data are at the heart of the ongoing DOGE saga. The Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing someone‚Äôs records‚Äîeven within the agency‚Äîunless that person approves in writing or the agency meets one of the law‚Äôs 12 exceptions. Most of the exceptions deal with fairly specific circumstances, such as congressional oversight, law enforcement investigations, court orders, census work, statistical research, and National Archives preservation. But there are also two broad, vague exceptions: Agencies can share records with their own employees who ‚Äú have a need  for the record in the performance of their duties‚Äù or with third parties for ‚Äú a routine use ‚Äù (defined as one that is ‚Äúcompatible with the purpose for which [the data] was collected‚Äù). Why Did Congress Pass the Privacy Act? President Richard Nixon illegally used the powers of the government to investigate, intimidate, and punish his political enemies. He  tried to use the IRS  to target liberal political groups with audits and scrutiny of their tax exemptions, and he  deployed the FBI  to spy on and harass his political opponents. After Nixon‚Äôs resignation over the Watergate scandal, lawmakers sought to prevent future presidents from weaponizing government power. ‚ÄúCongress must act before sophisticated new systems of information gathering and retention are developed, and before they produce widespread abuses,‚Äù North Carolina Democratic senator  Sam Ervin said  as he introduced one of the bills that inspired the Privacy Act. ‚ÄúThe peculiarity of new complex technologies is that once they go into operation, it is too late to correct our mistakes or supply our oversight.‚Äù After months of congressional wrangling that saw the elimination of Ervin‚Äôs proposed independent privacy oversight board, President Gerald Ford signed the Privacy Act into law on December 31, 1974. Ford, who had chaired the Domestic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy that Nixon created during his final months in office,  highlighted  ‚Äúthe vital need to provide adequate and uniform privacy safeguards for the vast amounts of personal information collected, recorded, and used in our complex society.‚Äù How Is This Relevant Today? DOGE‚Äôs critics‚Äîincluding Democratic lawmakers, federal employee unions, and government watchdog groups‚Äîargue that giving the office‚Äôs  young, controversial, and seemingly largely unvetted staffers  access to sensitive government data constitutes a major privacy breach. The incidents represent ‚Äúthe largest and most consequential breach of personal information in US history,‚Äù  according to John Davisson , a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of the groups suing to block DOGE‚Äôs access. The Trump administration, meanwhile, says DOGE employees need this data access to accomplish their mission of eliminating wasteful spending and shuttering programs that conflict with President Donald Trump‚Äôs agenda. After one federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE‚Äôs access to government payment systems, a White House spokesperson  called the ruling  ‚Äúabsurd and judicial overreach.‚Äù  Musk targeted the judge  on X, saying, ‚ÄúHe needs to be impeached NOW!‚Äù Can the Privacy Act Stop DOGE? It will depend on whether multiple judges agree with the Trump administration‚Äôs arguments claiming the law doesn‚Äôt prevent DOGE staffers from accessing agencies‚Äô sensitive data. The government contends that people can only sue agencies under the Privacy Act in one of four scenarios: when an agency refuses to grant someone access to a record about them; when an agency refuses to modify someone‚Äôs record as they requested; when an agency fails to keep someone‚Äôs record up to date and they experience concrete harm, such as a denial of benefits; or when an agency otherwise violates the law‚Äôs requirements in ways that adversely affect someone. It remains to be seen whether judges will determine that DOGE‚Äôs access to data adversely affects people. Agencies have also argued that they aren‚Äôt violating the Privacy Act because DOGE‚Äôs activities fall under the law‚Äôs ‚Äúroutine use‚Äù and ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù exceptions. In  a court filing  responding to one legal challenge, the Treasury Department said that DOGE personnel were accessing the data to identify potentially improper payments ‚Äúin furtherance of [their] duties‚Äù as directed by Trump (triggering the ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù exception) and that sharing this information with other agencies fell under one of the ‚Äúroutine uses‚Äù that the agency had previously disclosed as required by the Privacy Act. The strength of that argument rests on how judges weigh two questions: whether the DOGE personnel accessing each agency‚Äôs data are employees of those agencies, and whether the two exceptions apply to the situations in which they accessed and shared the data. Who‚Äôs Using the Privacy Act to Sue DOGE? There are at least eight lawsuits against the Trump administration over DOGE‚Äôs access to federal data, and all of them rely at least in part on the Privacy Act. The American Federation of Government Employees, the Association of Administrative Law Judges, and more than 100 current and former federal workers  are suing DOGE, Musk, and the Office of Personnel Management over what they claim is OPM‚Äôs illegal decision to give DOGE staffers access to a federal employee database, alleging that DOGE staffers ‚Äúlack a lawful and legitimate need for such access.‚Äù The Electronic Privacy Information Center , on behalf of an unnamed federal worker, is suing OPM, DOGE, and the Department of the Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to OPM‚Äôs personal database and Treasury‚Äôs payment system ‚Äúfor purposes impermissible under the Privacy Act.‚Äù The University of California Student Association  is suing the Department of Education for allegedly turning over student data to DOGE staffers who are not, in the language of the Privacy Act, ‚Äúemployees who have a need for the records in the performance of their duties.‚Äù Six government labor unions, two nonprofit groups, and the think tank Economic Policy Institute  are suing the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and DOGE to prevent the office from accessing a wide range of data, including federal workers‚Äô wage-theft complaints and injury reports, for purposes allegedly ‚Äúinconsistent with the Privacy Act.‚Äù Two government labor unions and the advocacy group Alliance for Retired Americans  are suing Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to Americans‚Äô tax returns in alleged violation of both the Privacy Act and  the Internal Revenue Service‚Äôs own special rules . The National Treasury Employees Union  is suing Acting CFPB director Russell Vought for giving information about CFPB employees to DOGE staffers, alleging their status as ‚Äúspecial government employees‚Äù places them outside the CFPB and thus outside the Privacy Act‚Äôs need-to-know exception. Nineteen state attorneys general  are suing Trump and Treasury over DOGE‚Äôs access to federal payment systems, arguing that because ‚Äúmany of the DOGE members given access to [the system] were not employees of Treasury,‚Äù that constitutes ‚Äúa violation of the Privacy Act.‚Äù Six Americans  are suing the Treasury and DOGE over what they describe as breaches of the sensitive personal data they gave the government while filing tax returns, applying for student loans, requesting disability payments, and receiving retirement benefits. Where Do These Cases Stand? In  the state AGs case ,  a judge quickly issued  a temporary restraining order restricting access to all Treasury systems storing sensitive personal and financial data. The case has since been assigned on a permanent basis to a different judge, who  adjusted the order slightly  after  the Trump administration objected  to its restrictions on political appointees. A status hearing took place on February 14. In  the EPIC case , the organization has  asked the judge  for a temporary restraining order blocking further DOGE access to certain Treasury and OPM systems. A status hearing will be held on February 21. In  the UC students case , the Department of Education  is arguing , among other things, that the students haven‚Äôt shown any harm; that the Privacy Act only allows courts to pause agency actions in two situations not applicable here; and that the DOGE staffers are Education Department employees allowed to access the data. On February 17, a judge  denied the students‚Äô motion  for a temporary restraining order, saying they had not suffered ‚Äúirreparable injury.‚Äù In  the Labor, HHS, and CFPB case ,  the judge rejected  the plaintiffs‚Äô request for a temporary restraining order, saying they failed to demonstrate the likely success of their arguments about the Privacy Act and other laws. But he also  questioned whether  DOGE staffers were employees of the agencies whose data they were accessing‚Äîa crucial question for a Privacy Act case. In  the Treasury case , the unions and ARA  have asked for  a temporary restraining order, but Treasury  is making  many of the same arguments as the Education Department, including that the Privacy Act can‚Äôt be used to pause DOGE staffers‚Äô access to data and invoking the need-to-know and routine-use exception. The judge in the case has  temporarily limited access  to Treasury‚Äôs payment system while weighing the plaintiffs‚Äô request for a restraining order. A hearing is scheduled for February 24. The  AFGE ,  NTEU , and  class-action  lawsuits haven‚Äôt proceeded beyond the filing of initial complaints.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/privacy-act-doge-lawsuits/"},

On Sunday, Sean Duffy, secretary of the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA,  announced  in a post on X that SpaceX engineers would be visiting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Virginia to take what he positioned as a tour. ‚ÄúThe safety of air travel is a nonpartisan matter,‚Äù Musk  replied . ‚ÄúSpaceX engineers will help make air travel safer.‚Äù By the time these posts were made, though, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, SpaceX engineers were already being onboarded at the agency under Schedule A, a  special authority  that allows government managers to ‚Äúhire persons with disabilities without requiring them to compete for the job,‚Äù  according  to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These new hires come after the terminations of hundreds of FAA probationary employees, and the most deadly month of US  aviation   disasters  in more than a decade. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, none of the SpaceX engineers were fully vetted by their start date. Unlike the  very young technologists  associated with Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) who have been given access to critical systems at agencies ranging  from OPM  and the  Treasury Department  to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  in recent weeks, though, the engineers identified by WIRED‚ÄîTed Malaska, Thomas Kiernan, Sam Smeal, and Brady Glantz‚Äîdo appear to have experience relevant to the FAA. Malaska is currently, according to his LinkedIn profile, a senior director of application software at SpaceX, where he started working in May 2021. Formerly the senior director of data engineering at Capitol One and a senior architect at FINRA, he graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2000 and cowrote a  2015 book  on Hadoop application architectures. Kiernan is currently a lead software engineer at SpaceX, according to his LinkedIn page. Before joining SpaceX in May 2020, he worked at Wayfair and is a 2017 Dartmouth graduate. Smeal is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since September 2021, according to his LinkedIn. He graduated from Saint Vincent College in 2018. Glantz is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since May 2024 and worked as an engineering analyst at Goldman Sachs from 2019 to 2021, according to his LinkedIn, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 2019. Malaska, Kiernan, Smeal, and Glantz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FAA also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Got a Tip?

In  his post on X , Duffy wrote, \"Because I know the media (and Hillary Clinton) will claim Elon‚Äôs team is getting special access, let me make clear that the @FAANews regularly gives tours of the command center to both media and companies.‚Äù But on Wednesday, FAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau wrote in an email to FAA staff, viewed by WIRED, that DOGE and the teams of special government employees deployed in federal agencies were ‚Äútop-of-mind,‚Äù before noting that the agency had \"recently welcomed‚Äù a team of special government employees who had already toured some FAA facilities. ‚ÄúWe are asking for their help to engineer solutions while we keep the airspace open and safe,‚Äù he wrote, adding that the new employees had already visited the FAA Command Center and Potomac TRACON, a facility that controls the airspace around and provides air traffic control services to airports in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia areas. In a Department of Transportation all-hands meeting late last week, Duffy responded to a question about DOGE's role in national airspace matters, and without explicitly mentioning the new employees, suggested help was needed on reforming Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM) alerts, a critical system that distributes real-time data and warnings to pilots but which has had  significant outages , one as recently as  this month . ‚ÄúIf I can get ideas from really smart engineers on how we can fix it, I‚Äôm going to take those ideas,‚Äù he said, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúGreat engineers‚Äù might also work on airspace issues, he said. SpaceX functioned as the pre-inauguration staging ground for the DOGE team, according to reporting from  The New York Times  and sources who spoke to WIRED. In the months between November 5 and January 20, members of DOGE including Steve Davis (president of Musk‚Äôs Boring Company) and the young engineer Luke Farritor were operating out of the company‚Äôs DC office, according to a source with knowledge. The company did not respond to questions about whether these employees will retain their salaries and positions at the company during their time with DOGE. Many of the so-called department‚Äôs operatives have joined as ‚Äúspecial government employees,‚Äù who are limited to working 130 days in a year. Last week  WIRED reported  that Tom Krause, a DOGE operative at the Treasury Department, would continue to maintain his position as CEO of the Cloud Software Group while also performing the duties of fiscal assistant secretary. Other members of Musk‚Äôs companies, including xAI and Tesla, have also taken on positions with DOGE. Late last week, the  Trump administration laid off   400  FAA workers, according to Duffy. One union that represents some of these workers, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, says these included probationary employees who worked on aviation safety and maintenance. Air traffic controllers were not affected by the layoffs, Duffy  said in an X post . Just two weeks before that, the US suffered its most deadly aviation incident in more than a decade, when 67 people died after an Army helicopter  collided with a passenger jet  in Washington, DC. Though initial findings suggest  complex equipment and communications issues  possibly played roles in the disaster, President Trump was quick to blame ‚ÄúDEI,‚Äù railing against a decade-old program that helps the FAA identify talent among populations with disabilities. People with disabilities hired into the FAA and other federal agencies are often accepted under the Schedule A authority‚Äîexactly the route these new engineers have taken into the agency. The FAA has frequently tangled with Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, as the rocket company and others fight to operate their own interests in crowded American airspace. In January, the FAA temporarily grounded SpaceX‚Äôs program after one of its Starship rockets broke apart midflight,  reportedly  damaging public property on Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean. The FAA diverted dozens of commercial airline flights following the explosion and announced an investigation into the incident, which is ongoing and being led by SpaceX. Musk, however,  characterized  the failure as ‚Äúbarely a bump in the road‚Äù and  did not seem to indicate  that the investigation would slow SpaceX‚Äôs launch cadence. Last year, the company indicated it was aiming for  25 launches of the Starship in 2025 . FAA spokesperson Steven Kulm told WIRED that ‚Äúthe FAA is overseeing the SpaceX-led mishap investigation.‚Äù The FAA did not respond to further questions about whether the presence of SpaceX engineers at the agency would constitute a conflict of interest. In September, the FAA  proposed   $633,000  in fines following two 2023 incidents in which SpaceX allegedly did not follow its license requirements, violating regulations. Responding to an X user posting about the penalties, Musk  wrote , ‚ÄúThe fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!‚Äù Shortly afterward, Musk called for FAA head Mike Whitaker  to resign . In January, more than three years before his term was due to end, Whitaker did resign. ‚ÄúI told Elon, any conflicts, you can‚Äôt have anything to do with that,‚Äù said President Trump in a  press conference this week, in response to a question about Musk, SpaceX, the FAA, and conflicts of interest.  ‚ÄúSo anything to do with possibly even space, we won‚Äôt let Elon partake in that.‚Äù The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SpaceX is directly regulated by a small FAA agency called the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which since 1984 has licensed the launch of US space rockets. ‚ÄúThe purpose is to ensure public safety,‚Äù says George Nield, a former associate administrator of the office. ‚ÄúPeople on the ground did not consent‚Äù to rocket launches above them, he says. ‚ÄùWe absolutely need to keep them safe. The office has done a great job of that.‚Äù The office oversaw 157 launches in 2024 alone. On February 10, several days after Musk  posted  on X that DOGE ‚Äúwill aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,‚Äù a group of Democratic legislators  wrote  to Rocheleau‚Äîa career civil servant whose ties to the FAA go back to 1996‚Äîrequesting information about any planned changes to FAA systems. ‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned that an ad hoc team of individuals lacking any expertise, exposure, certifications, or knowledge of aviation operations being invited, or inserting themselves, to make ‚Äòrapid‚Äô changes to our nation‚Äôs air traffic systems,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúAviation safety is not an area to ‚Äòmove fast and break things.‚Äô‚Äù Updated February 24, 2025, at 11:15 am EDT: This story was updated with a clarification of which employees were included in the recent layoffs.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/faa-doge-elon-musk-space-x/"},

Similar restrictions are expected to roll out to the entire government workforce soon, according to several sources familiar with the matter. ‚ÄúEffective immediately, all GSA SmartPay Travel and Purchase Cards issued to GSA employees and contractors are being paused and will not be available for use except in very limited circumstances,‚Äù GSA wrote in a memo to staff Thursday morning viewed by WIRED. The memo later stated that for ‚Äúup to 0.1% of the GSA workforce, requests may be made for certain individual purchase charge card spend thresholds be set above $1. Please provide the rationale for all such deviations on an employee-by-employee basis along with the proposed increased threshold.‚Äù The GSA, one of the first agencies that  Musk allies infiltrated  after DOGE was established, manages the SmartPay program for more than 250 federal agencies and organizations. The SmartPay  website  claims it is ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program.‚Äù The spending freeze comes after DOGE posted on X earlier this week that it was working to ‚Äú simplify ‚Äù the government credit card program and ‚Äúreduce costs.‚Äù The restrictions immediately apply to GSA, the Office of Personnel Management, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and the  United States Agency for International Development , according to a source with direct knowledge of the project. All four of the agencies have been prominent targets of DOGE in recent weeks. Employees who spoke with WIRED say the changes will result in enormous complications to their existing workflows and that excessive or fraudulent spending is rare. Those who‚Äôve already received approval for travel expenses (and may currently be traveling) have to request a temporary spending limit increase, the sources say. One important reason that federal employees typically put expenses on special government-issued credit cards is to ensure they avoid paying state sales tax on things like hotels and rental cars, which federal agencies are supposed to be exempt from.

As DOGE attempts to cut billions of dollars from the federal budget, Elon Musk has been posting examples of alleged ‚Äúfraud‚Äù his team has uncovered to his over 218 million followers on X. In some cases, reporting from WIRED and  other outlets  suggests DOGE may be misinterpreting or misrepresenting what they‚Äôve found. For example, Musk has falsely claimed that 150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits. Experts  told WIRED that  DOGE likely overlooked a quirk in the payments system that doles out these benefits, which automatically sets a person‚Äôs birthday to May 20, 1875 if the real date is unknown, making these individuals appear to be 150 in the system. The new spending restrictions apply to both SmartPay travel and purchase cards. Travel cards are widely used across the government (for example, most army reservists have these cards). The government tracks travel expenses, like hotel and airline fees, through software tools like Concur. The GSA already requires receipts for any purchase that its employees make over $75. ‚ÄúThe system is a pain in the ass and requires authorization from a supervisor before any money can be spent,‚Äù says a current GSA employee. Once a trip is done, employees have to submit a voucher that matches the approved expenses. Expenses are scrupulously tracked‚Äîemployees are told to minimize ATM withdrawals to avoid unnecessary fees, according to a current GSA employee, who like the others in this story, spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They say misusing a card is already grounds for disciplinary action, including termination. Purchase cards are more rare and are used for work expenses under $10,000; anything above this amount requires a formal government contract. They‚Äôre used for office supplies, IT equipment, and trainings, among other things. If employees want to spend money on a purchase card, they have to submit a form, which then needs to be approved and signed by a supervisor. When that‚Äôs done, the form is submitted for approval to the approving office, with the name of the person who wants to make the purchase, a description of the item, the estimated price, an accounting code, and the date when the goods or services are needed. Once the payment is approved, it‚Äôs assigned a purchase request number. Only then can the employee actually spend money. If they spend 10 percent more than the approved amount, they need written approval again. At the GSA, each purchase is tracked through a program called Pegasys, which requires a separate form to access. Pegasys has two sides: The purchase side, which shows the money that was spent, and the reconciliation side. The card holder has to match these two sides, cent for cent, using the request number. ‚ÄúTo commit fraud, you‚Äôd have to have the employee, supervisor, and likely someone in finance in on it,‚Äù says another current GSA employee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as easy as [DOGE is] claiming.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-government-credit-cards/"},

The  Office of Personnel Management , which functions as the human resources department of the US government, tells retirees to expect a  three- to five-month  wait to process their applications. And retirement paperwork for federal employees does route through a storage facility in a repurposed limestone mine in rural Boyers, about 50 miles north of Pittsburgh. When the system at Boyers was first established decades ago, putting retiree archives and processing files under one roof that was both remote and secure made a lot of sense. But over time, a systematic lack of resources, combined with repeated failed attempts to automate and digitize, created the ‚Äú sinkhole of bureaucracy ‚Äù that is the federal retirement hub today. Six years ago, the Government Accountability Office  reported  that the OPM‚Äôs retirement system was still plagued by a ‚Äúcontinuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing.‚Äù The agency's average retirement file processing time was about 60 days in 2019, which is only a modest decrease from 1981, when it took  98 days , but the agency processed almost twice as many applications. But David Carmicheal, who recently retired as state archivist of Pennsylvania and has corresponded with staff at the Boyers facility, tells WIRED it‚Äôs a mistake to only view OPM‚Äôs process as ‚Äúwoefully outdated.‚Äù ‚ÄúMuch of the work that goes on at Boyers, as I understand it, is digital, so the idea of people trundling piles of paper through dark mine shafts is absurd,‚Äù Carmicheal says. ‚ÄúIn fact, these facilities are meant to protect you and me by protecting the records that safeguard our legal rights, our public benefits.‚Äù When reached for comment, the Government Accountability Office referred WIRED to its most recent publications. The Office of Personnel Management did not respond to a request for comment. Going Underground The Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the OPM, started mailing retirement files to Boyers in 1960 with the intent to archive them ‚Äú forever .‚Äù The CSC was one of many agencies that took advantage of repurposed mines and caves during the Cold War, seeking enhanced protection for sensitive materials in the event of a nuclear catastrophe. The Boyers mine was operational from 1902 to roughly 1959 under the helm of US Steel. When high operating costs and dwindling demand for limestone caused the business to decline in the 1950s, US Steel employee Larry Yont saw an opportunity to repurpose the site as a storage facility and, with the help of civil engineer and mine superintendent Russell Mitchell, went on to found National Underground Storage. It was later bought by the company Iron Mountain in 1998, which owns and leases the Boyers mine to this day. Along with the Civil Service Commission, other federal agencies, including the National Archives, the Office of Civil Defense (the precursor to the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and the Social Security Administration began storing records in the Boyers facility around the same time. J. G. Franz, then office manager of the Boyers mine, told a newspaper reporter in 1966 that federal agencies have ‚Äúbackup equipment for everything‚Äù stored in a special area of Boyers to protect the records in the event of nuclear fallout. Franz told a local newspaper that workers ‚Äúhope we will never have to worry about a nuclear explosion,‚Äù but that if one happened, the mine would be safely sealed off, according to newspaper archives reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúThe mine is equipped with a 30-day supply of food and supplies for all of the employees.‚Äù At the time, the staff at Boyers were reportedly able to process about 600 pounds of records each day bussed to the facility straight from Washington, DC. They relied on the recently constructed interstate highway system for timely deliveries. In fact, the federal government built an exit off Pennsylvania‚Äôs Interstate 80 specifically for ‚Äúquick access to the mine in case of an emergency,‚Äù according to an article in the Pittsburgh Press. There are other practical benefits that make old mines a good place to store records. For one, their typically rural and secluded settings create a layer of natural security from other types of threats. Repurposed mines provide ‚Äúexcellent fire protection,‚Äù and immunity from events like ‚Äúflood, theft, civil disorder, aircraft crashes, tornadoes, lightning,‚Äù noted a  1999 Iron Mountain presentation  for the National Archives. Carmichael tells WIRED that access to the underground facilities he‚Äôs visited tend to be tightly controlled, often through heavily guarded entrances. These facilities also frequently have maze-like designs that would likely discourage or confuse thieves if they somehow got inside. Several current managers of repurposed limestone mines told WIRED that their caves are naturally between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, optimal temperature for most storage situations. John Smith, director of industrial real estate for the company that manages the limestone storage facility  Carefree Industrial Park  near Kansas City, Missouri, said that this means utility costs are ‚Äúdramatically lower‚Äù compared to above-ground facilities. His main expenses are associated with ventilation, since caves tend to be very humid. It All Goes Wrong Shortly before the Civil Service Commission arrived at Boyers, the US federal retirement apparatus was a mess.  A 1951 government report  found that ‚Äúan adequate record system‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even in place yet and urged Congress to ‚Äúinsist‚Äù one be created. At first, it seemed like the team at Boyers was able to turn things around. The News-Herald reported in 1966 that with just 55 employees, the system at the mine was operating ‚Äúwith the same efficiency and effectiveness as it used to in Washington, DC.‚Äù However, as the number of retirees continued to climb, things fell into disarray. By the early 1980s, the Office of Personnel Management was being audited to find the root causes of excessive delays in processing retirement claims. In 1981, the Government Accountability Office recommended that OPM ‚Äúdevelop a long-term plan for automating the retirement claims process.‚Äù OPM tried to launch an automated system in 1987, only to shut it down in 1996 when it failed an independent review. It began planning a new system, but gave up in 2001 and decided to contract the work out. The contracts weren‚Äôt awarded until 2006. The system they eventually built, RetireEZ, was finally launched in 2008, but it too was promptly shut down due to ‚Äúquality issues.‚Äù Little progress was made until 2013, when OPM launched a new ‚Äústrategic vision‚Äù for a totally ‚Äúpaperless system.‚Äù Around that time, the agency was able to partially digitize the retirement process, allowing retirees to receive 80 percent of their pension quickly. But to get the full value, physical files still had to go through Boyers, according to a 2014  feature story  in The Washington Post. By 2019, the Government Accountability Office reported that OPM didn‚Äôt have enough money to finish digitizing. The agency was then piloting what it called the Electronic Retirement Record system, which was supposed to replace hard copies altogether. As part of the improvements, OPM was also trying to fix ‚Äúinconsistent data between electronic and paper records,‚Äù according to the Government Accountability Office. Boyers workers  would sometimes have to  track down the physical copies of records by navigating through what had become essentially a small city of shelves and files, or type up other files that weren‚Äôt digitized. Despite all of these efforts, the OPM  still hasn‚Äôt finished  digitizing the retirement process. It‚Äôs been a decade since the agency updated its  internal guide  for processing retirement applications. The Government Accountability Office  attributed  the slow pace of progress to ‚Äúthe continuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing,‚Äù lack of staffing, and OPM frequently receiving incomplete submissions. Musk and DOGE have  defunded  and  started to hollow out  a slew of government agencies. While the centibillionaire has identified Boyers as a prime example of government inefficiency, he hasn‚Äôt described a clear vision for fixing the retirement system. Despite their shortcomings, Carmicheal tells WIRED that it‚Äôs important to remember why government bureaucracies and record-keeping systems were set up in the first place. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thankful that we have had a long history in this country of governments that care about protecting their citizens,‚Äù Carmichael says, ‚Äúand that includes safeguarding the records that document our rights and the responsibility of governments toward us.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/limestone-mine-elon-musk-retirement/"},

Unfolding like short chapters in a dystopian novel, they have spoken of the genius of Elon Musk, referenced the power of the billionaire‚Äôs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE), and foretold the downfall of ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù union bosses. But the most eerie thing about the emails, which Bernier says began arriving after he filed an official charge accusing the Trump administration of violating his union‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement, is that they included personal details about his life‚Äîsome of which he believes might have come from surveillance of his work laptop. The author referenced Bernier‚Äôs union activities, nickname, job, travel details, and even the green notebook he regularly uses. The most recent email implied that his computer was loaded with spyware. ‚ÄúAndy's crusade, like so many before it, had been doomed from the start,‚Äù one email stated. ‚ÄúThe real tragedy wasn't his failure‚Äîit was his belief that the fight had ever been real.‚Äù The unsettling messages, which were reviewed by WIRED, are an extreme example of the kinds of encounters that workers across the US government say they have had with technology since President Donald Trump took office. WIRED spoke to current employees at 13 federal agencies for this story who expressed fears about potentially being monitored by software programs, some of which they described as unfamiliar. Others said that routine software updates and notifications, perhaps once readily glossed over, have taken on ominous new meanings. Several reported feeling anxious and hyperaware of the devices and technology around them. At the General Services Administration (GSA), one worker cited a Chrome browser extension called Dynatrace, an existing program for monitoring app performance. Inside the Social Security Administration, another employee pointed to Splunk, a long-standing tool that‚Äôs used to alert IT staff to  security anomalies  like when an unauthorized USB drive is plugged into a laptop. At the US Agency for International Development, one worker was caught off guard by  Google‚Äôs Gemini AI chatbot , installations of which  kicked off days before  Trump took office. ‚ÄúEveryone has been talking about whether our laptops are now able to listen to our conversations and track what we do,‚Äù says a current GSA employee, who like other workers in this story was granted anonymity because they didn‚Äôt have authorization to speak and feared retaliation. Dynatrace and Splunk did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED. The workers‚Äô accounts come as Musk‚Äôs DOGE organization is rapidly burrowing into various government agencies and departments, often gaining access to  personnel records ,  logs of financial transactions , and  other sensitive information  in the process. The efforts are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs  broader plan  to terminate thousands of government employees and remake the face of federal agencies. Like many private companies, US federal agencies disclose to staff that they have tools to monitor what workers do on their computers and networks. The US government‚Äôs capabilities in this area have also expanded over the past decade. It couldn‚Äôt be learned whether the Trump administration has begun using existing tools to monitor employees in new ways; multiple agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration, denied that they have. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Public evidence has not emerged of new government purchases of user-monitoring software, which is generally needed for detailed surveillance such as tracking which files a worker has copied onto a thumb drive. Some of the updates and changes that have been noticed by federal workers date back to software purchases and plans enacted long before Trump was in power, WIRED reporting shows. ‚ÄúI will say my concerns are primarily based in general fear as opposed to specific knowledge,‚Äù says a worker at the Department of Homeland Security, who adds: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be told I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù But activity that some workers perceive as signs of increased surveillance has prompted them to take precautions. Bernier, who works as a civil engineer for the Army Corps based in Hanover, New Hampshire, says the messages he received spooked him enough that he asked local police to keep an eye on his home, removed the battery from his work-issued laptop, and kept his work phone on airplane mode while traveling to a nonwork conference last week. ‚ÄúThere are things I don‚Äôt control but actions I can take to protect myself and my family,‚Äù he says. Bernier‚Äôs anonymous emailer and the Army Corps did not respond to requests for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

A person inside the Environmental Protection Agency told WIRED last week that they‚Äôve witnessed coworkers back out of  Microsoft Teams  meetings, which can be easily recorded and automatically transcribed, when they are related to topics they believe could get them fired. ‚ÄúDefinite chilling effect,‚Äù the person says. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment. An employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose work with international partners is being  audited by DOGE operatives , says they and their colleagues began avoiding messaging one another and have ‚Äúreally cut down on putting things in writing‚Äù in recent weeks. They report that correspondence from their supervisors has also significantly dropped off. The NOAA declined to comment. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, anxiety around officials  possibly targeting  officers and activities perceived as being disloyal to the president has cratered morale, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the agents' concerns tells WIRED. The FBI declined to comment. Aryani Ong, a civil rights activist and cofounder of Asian American Federal Employees for Nondiscrimination, a group that advocates for government workers, says those she‚Äôs been in contact with are in a heightened state of alert. In response, some federal employees have turned to encrypted communications apps to connect with colleagues and taken steps to anonymize their social media accounts, Ong says. (Federal workers  are granted an allowance  to use nonofficial communication tools only ‚Äúin exceptional circumstances.‚Äù) Insider Threat Long before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, user activity monitoring was already mandated for federal agencies and networks that handle classified information‚Äîthe result of an  executive order  signed by President Barack Obama in the wake of a massive breach of  classified diplomatic cables and information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  in 2010. The capability is part of government-wide insider-threat programs that greatly expanded after  Edward Snowden‚Äôs leak  of classified surveillance documents in 2013 and again after an Army specialist murdered three colleagues and injured 16 others at Fort Hood in 2014. The US government‚Äôs current approach to digitally monitoring federal workers has largely been guided by a  directive  issued by the Committee on National Security Systems in 2014, which orders relevant agencies to tie user activity to ‚Äúspecific users.‚Äù The public portions of the document call for ‚Äúevery executive branch department and agency‚Äù handling classified information to have capabilities to take screenshots, capture keystrokes, and intercept chats and email on employee devices. They are also instructed to deploy ‚Äúfile shadowing,‚Äù meaning secretly producing facsimiles of every file a user edits or opens. The insider threat programs at departments such as  Health and Human Services ,  Transportation , and  Veterans Affairs , also have policies that protect unclassified government information, which enable them to monitor employees‚Äô clicks and communications, according to notices in the Federal Register, an official source of rulemaking documents. Policies for the  Department of the Interior , the  Internal Revenue Service , and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate , also allow collecting and assessing employees‚Äô social media content. These internal agency programs, overseen by a national task force led by the attorney general and director of national intelligence, aim to identify behaviors that may indicate the heightened risk of not only leaks and workplace violence, but also the ‚Äúloss‚Äù or \"degradation\" of a federal agency‚Äôs ‚Äú resources or capabilities .‚Äù Over 60 percent of insider-threat incidents in the federal sector involve fraud, such as stealing money or taking someone's personal information, and are non-espionage related, according to  analysis  by Carnegie Mellon researchers. ‚Äú Fraud ,‚Äù ‚Äúdisgruntlement,‚Äù ‚Äú ideological challenges ,‚Äù ‚Äú moral outrage ,‚Äù or discussion of moral concerns deemed ‚Äúunrelated to work duties‚Äù are some of the possible signs that a worker poses a threat, according to US government training literature. Of the 15 Cabinet-level departments such as energy, labor, and veterans affairs, at least nine had contracts as of late last year with suppliers such as Everfox and Dtex Systems that allowed for digitally monitoring of a portion of employees, according to  public spending data . Everfox declined to comment. Dtex‚Äôs Intercept software, which is used by multiple federal agencies, is one example of a newer class of programs that generate individual risk scores by analyzing anonymized metadata, such as which URLs workers are visiting and which files they‚Äôre opening and printing out on their work devices, according to the company. When an agency wants to identify and further investigate someone with a high score, two people have to sign off in some versions of its tool, according to the company. Dtex‚Äôs software doesn‚Äôt have to log keystrokes or scan the content of emails, calls, chats, or social media posts. But that isn't how things work broadly across the government, where employees are warned explicitly in  a recurring message  when they boot up their devices that they have \"no reasonable expectation of privacy\" in their communications or in any data stored or transmitted through government networks. The question remains if and to what extent DOGE‚Äôs operatives are relying on existing monitoring programs to carry out Trump‚Äôs mission to rapidly  eliminate federal workers  that his administration views as unaligned with the president‚Äôs agenda or disloyal. Rajan Koo, the chief technology officer of Dtex tells WIRED that he hopes the Trump administration will adjust the government‚Äôs approach to monitoring. Events such as widespread layoffs coupled with a reliance on what Koo described as intrusive surveillance tools can stir up an environment in which workers feel disgruntled, he says. ‚ÄúYou can create a culture of reciprocal loyalty,‚Äù says Koo, or ‚Äúthe perfect breeding ground for insider threats.‚Äù Already Overwhelmed Sources with knowledge of the US government‚Äôs insider-threat programs describe them as largely inefficient and labor intensive, requiring overstretched teams of analysts to manually pore through daily barrages of alerts that include many false positives. Multiple sources said that the systems are currently ‚Äúoverwhelmed.‚Äù Any effort by the Trump administration to extend the reach of such tools or widen their parameters‚Äîto more closely surveil for perceived signs of insubordination or disloyalty to partisan fealties, for instance‚Äîlikely would result in a significant spike in false positives that would take considerable time to comb through, according to the people familiar with the work. In  an email last month  seeking  federal employees‚Äô voluntary resignations , the Trump administration wrote that it wanted a ‚Äúreliable, loyal, trustworthy‚Äù workforce. Attempts to use insider-threat programs to enforce that vision could be met by a number of legal challenges. US intelligence community analysts are required  by law  and  directive  to provide unbiased and objective work. That means avoiding cherry-picking information to deliberately alter judgements or falling prey to outside pressure, including from personal or political biases. These standards, even when not officially codified, are core to the professional ethics of any  intelligence practitioner  or  law enforcement  analyst conducting assessments of insider threats. A 2018 national insider-threat task force  framework  notes that federal programs should comply with ‚Äúall applicable legal, privacy and civil liberties rights, and whistleblower protections.‚Äù Bradley Moss, an attorney representing US intelligence and law enforcement personnel, says that \"disloyalty\" to the Trump administration is ‚Äútoo vague‚Äù an excuse to terminate employees with civil service protections, adding that if \"they're going to go through the statutory process, they need to demonstrate actual cause for termination.\" A federal law enforcement source warns that monitoring could theoretically be used to gather political intelligence on federal employees, while the administration looks for more palatable reasons to terminate them later; similar to how law enforcement may obtain evidence that's inadmissible in the course of a criminal investigation, but then search for  another evidentiary basis  to file charges. Joe Spielberger, senior legal counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan group fighting alleged corruption, says that if Musk were serious about cutting government waste, he would be strengthening  protections for people who report corruption and mismanagement . Any warrantless or mass surveillance of federal workers without transparent guidelines, he says, would represent a major concern. ‚ÄúWhen you create this culture of fear and intimidation and have that chilling effect of making people even more fearful about calling out wrongdoing, it ensures that corruption goes unnoticed and unaddressed,‚Äù Spielberger says.

Scientists hit by the layoffs were working on projects to improve crops, defend against pests and disease, and understand the climate impact of farming practices. The layoffs also threaten to undermine billions of taxpayer dollars paid to farmers to support conservation practices, experts warn. The USDA layoffs are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs mass firing of federal employees, mainly targeting people who are in their probationary periods ahead of gaining full-time status, which for USDA scientists can be up to three years. The agency has not released exact firing figures, but they are estimated to include many hundreds of staff at critical scientific subagencies and a reported  3,400 employees  in the Forest Service. Employees were told of their firing in a blanket email sent on February 13 and seen by WIRED. ‚ÄúThe Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,‚Äù the email says. One laid-off employee described the weeks preceding the firing as ‚Äúchaos,‚Äù as the USDA paused (in response  to orders from  the Trump administration) and then unpaused (in response to a court order) work connected to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)‚Äîthe landmark 2022 law passed under President Joe Biden that set aside large amounts of federal money for climate policies. ‚ÄúIt was just pause, unpause, pause, unpause. After four or five business days of that, I‚Äôm thinking, I literally can‚Äôt get anything done,‚Äù says the former employee, who worked on IRA-linked projects and asked to remain anonymous to protect them from retribution. The IRA provided the USDA with $300 million to help with the quantification of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This money was intended to support the $8.45 billion in farmer subsidies authorized in the IRA to be spent on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)‚Äîa plan to encourage farmers to take up  practices with potential environmental benefits , such as cover cropping and better waste storage. At least one contracted farming project funded by EQIP has been paused by the Trump administration,  Reuters reports . The $300 million was supposed to be used to establish an agricultural greenhouse gas network that could monitor the effectiveness of the kinds of conservation practices funded by EQIP and other multibillion-dollar conservation programs, says Emily Bass, associate director of federal policy, food, and agriculture at the environmental research center the Breakthrough Institute. This work was being carried out in part by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), two of the scientific sub-agencies hit heavily by the federal layoffs. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what‚Äôs happening? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a ton of taxpayer dollars, and the quantification work of ARS and NRCS is an essential part of measuring those programs‚Äô actual impacts on emissions reductions,‚Äù says Bass. ‚ÄúStopping or hamstringing efforts midway is a huge waste of resources that have already been spent.‚Äù One current ARS scientist, who spoke to WIRED anonymously, as they were not authorized to talk to the press, claims that at their unit almost 40 percent of scientists have been fired along with multiple support staff. Many of their unit‚Äôs projects are now in disarray, the scientist says, including work that has been planned out in five-year cycles and requires close monitoring of plant specimens. ‚ÄúIn the short term we can keep that material alive, but we can‚Äôt necessarily do that indefinitely if we don‚Äôt have anybody on that project.‚Äù In a  press release , the USDA has said its plan is to ‚Äúoptimize its workforce,‚Äù with this including ‚Äúrelocating employees out of the National Capital region into our nation‚Äôs heartland to allow our rural communities to flourish.‚Äù But ARS units are located across the US, each one specializing in crops that are important to local farmers as well as bringing jobs to the region. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been very popular in rural areas because the farmers and growers actually want what we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù says the ARS scientist. The USDA did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. The hollowing-out of staff capacity will limit the USDA‚Äôs ability to implement IRA policies, says Bass, but it is not clear that this was the sole intention of the cuts. ‚ÄúThis seems to be a sledgehammer to the workforce in a way that will just roll back the number of folks on payroll,‚Äù she says. The purge could also indirectly hit farmers in red states, who are the main beneficiaries of proposals such as EQIP. ‚ÄúIt was necessary research to preserve our agricultural lands and fight climate change,‚Äù says one ARS employee who was fired last week after serving more than two years of their three-year-long probation. ‚ÄúCompared to the rest of the government, ARS is tiny,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúBut we were able to get a lot done with relatively little money.‚Äù On her first full day in office, US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins told USDA staffers gathered at its headquarters in Washington that she supported the Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs attempt to optimize the USDA workforce. ‚ÄúI welcome DOGE‚Äôs efforts at USDA, because we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient,‚Äù she told the gathering. But Bass warns that blanket firing of USDA employees is hardly a pathway toward a more efficient agency. ‚ÄúThis approach of wide-swath firings throws the USDA and affiliated agricultural research enterprise into a world of uncertainty,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúProjects that cannot be seen out to the end, cannot result in a peer-reviewed research paper or technical expertise being provided, are a waste of taxpayer dollars.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/usda-layoffs-throw-climate-and-crop-projects-into-chaos/"},

WIRED reporting shows not only which DOGE members are at the NIH but also the sensitive financial system at least some of them have access to. Government records reviewed by WIRED show that the four people associated with DOGE have email addresses linking them to the NIH, the federal agency for health research in the US. Internal documents reviewed by WIRED show that three of these employees are employed in the department that controls the NIH‚Äôs central electronic business system, which includes finance, budget, procurement, a property-management system, and a grant-tracking system. The DOGE operatives listed in government records are Luke Farritor, Rachel Riley, Jeremy Lewin, and Clark Minor. Farritor is a former SpaceX intern and current Thiel fellow who also has a working email address linking him to the General Services Administration (GSA). Minor, a former engineer at Palantir, is, as has been  reported , the chief information officer of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Lewin is an agency lead at DOGE, according to  ProPublica ; he has a GSA email and has been named in  an affidavit related to a lawsuit  as having been involved in the gutting of the  US Agency for International Development . Riley works closely with Brad Smith, a former health care entrepreneur and DOGE leader prior to President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, according to  The New York Times . Internal documents list Farritor, Riley, and Minor as working under the umbrella of the NIH Business System Department. NBS is the central electronic business system of the NIH, according to the  agency‚Äôs website . The NBS sits within the NIH‚Äôs  Office of Management , under the Office of the Director, and administers the core running of the NIH, including procurement, property management, data consolidation, and financial reporting. One NIH employee, who was granted anonymity as they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, referred to NBS as ‚ÄúNIH‚Äôs wallet.‚Äù Got a Tip?

The NIH did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. The NIH is the largest federal funder of biomedical research and a key sub-agency within HHS‚Äîthe government agency now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier in February the NIH dramatically slashed the funding it gives to universities, leaning heavily on a report by the Heritage Foundation that  railed against  the ‚Äúmassive growth in DEI staff at US universities.‚Äù The NIH, which has a budget of $48 billion, has also frozen funding for applications for $1.5 billion in medical research, according to  NPR . DOGE workers, according to WIRED reporting, have effectively taken over key government agencies, including the  Office of Personnel Management  and the  GSA . On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government were left in confusion after  receiving an email from the OPM  demanding that they reply with ‚Äúapprox 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.‚Äù The Trump administration‚Äôs executive orders and policies have also wreaked havoc on domestic and international research.

Confusion, chaos, and resentment among a federal workforce that increasingly feels  under attack . ‚ÄúSo fucking dumb,‚Äù says one air traffic controller who received the email and was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents ATC personnel, told its members not to respond until Federal Aviation Administration leadership provided guidance. Leaders of many agencies appear to have been caught off guard. At the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which houses the National Weather Service, some managers initially cautioned against replying to the email in case it was a phishing attempt. Another NOAA employee says they were cautioned not to log on to their work email after receiving it. Other workers were met with conflicting guidance from their managers. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is  anticipating deep cuts  orchestrated by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some employees reported being told to await further guidance while others say their managers instructed people to comply. The email appears to have been sent even to federal judges. ‚ÄúWe understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email from  HR@opm.gov ,‚Äù read an email from the director‚Äôs office of the Department of Administrative Services for US Federal Courts. ‚ÄúPlease be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken.‚Äù At least some military personnel also received the email and have been told to await guidance from the Department of Defense. That holding pattern appears to be the response at most agencies, where workers say they have not heard from senior leadership if and how they should handle this latest escalation in  Musk and DOGE‚Äôs ongoing efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce . At the National Institutes of Health, for instance, in an email with the subject line ‚ÄúPlease Await Guidance,‚Äù some workers were told that ‚Äúinformation is forthcoming,‚Äù without any indication of when or from whom. Another consideration for many is not only whether they should reply but how. While the OPM email specified that employees should not send classified information, links, or attachments, that severely limits how workers at many government agencies might be able to respond. ‚ÄúNational security staff are getting notified of OPM‚Äôs request, which is taking them from the important work of ensuring national security interests,‚Äù said one source, who was granted anonymity due to the nature of their work. ‚ÄúThese are essential employees who keep us safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Executive Committee is currently reviewing this request to determine appropriate guidelines regarding what information can be shared outside of the agency,‚Äù reads an email from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which sits within the Treasury Department. ‚ÄúPlease wait for additional guidance.‚Äù NBC News  reported  Saturday that even  Kash Patel, the newly installed Federal Bureau of Investigation  director and close ally of President Donald Trump, has instructed employees not to respond to the OPM email. The State Department also told workers not to engage. ‚ÄúThe State Department will respond on behalf of the Department,‚Äù reads an email from leadership, viewed by WIRED and  first reported  by journalist Marisa Kabas of  the Handbasket . ‚ÄúNo employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.‚Äù Got a Tip?

This is not the first time that OPM, which operates as effectively the government‚Äôs human resources department and is  currently run by associates of Musk , has thrown the government into a state of alarm. In late January, OPM sent an email with the subject line ‚ÄúFork in the Road,‚Äù offering deferred resignation to anyone opposed to the new administration‚Äôs return-to-office policy or stated desire for employees who are ‚Äúreliable‚Äù and ‚Äúloyal.‚Äù That email was  strikingly similar to one that Musk sent  early in his Twitter takeover. Ultimately, according to White House figures, 75,000 emails took the deferred resignation offer; given annual turnover rates in the massive federal workforce, it‚Äôs likely that many if not most of those who took the offer were retiring or otherwise set to leave anyway. This latest email also closely resembles one that Musk  sent  to Twitter staff in June 2023. While Musk has publicly presented himself as responsible for the email‚Äîand is the only source of the forced resignation threat‚Äîit‚Äôs unclear under what authority he would be able to fire federal employees at will over an email response. The White House has asserted in court documents that Musk is a ‚Äúsenior advisor‚Äù  rather than the administrator of DOGE  or otherwise in a position of real power. ‚ÄúLike other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,‚Äù the director of the White House Office of Administration  wrote  in a sworn statement.

On Sunday night, Trump announced on Truth Social that Bongino had been appointed as the agency‚Äôs deputy director. Bongino, who previously served as a police officer in New York and as a Secret Service agent protecting former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, has no FBI experience‚Äîa trait he shares with  Kash Patel, the QAnon-promoting Trump loyalist  who was last week confirmed as the new director of the FBI. The deputy director role, which oversees day-to-day operations of the bureau, has typically gone to an experienced FBI agent. In January, after he was nominated but before he was confirmed by the Senate, Patel met with two senior members of the FBI Agents Association, and, Patel ‚Äúprivately agreed‚Äù that ‚Äúthe FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent‚Äîas has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons.‚Äù This information was shared with the associations‚Äô members in a memo sent on Sunday evening, an hour before Trump announced Bongino‚Äôs appointment, according to a copy of the newsletter reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúThere is a ton of concern that someone with no experience in the Bureau is appointed to, in the view of agents, a position that is even more important than the director,‚Äù one member of the association told WIRED. The person was granted anonymity over fears of recrimination from the new FBI leadership. Neither the FBI Agents Association nor a spokesperson for Patel immediately responded to a request for comment. Bongino is a Trump loyalist who has in the past referred to the president as ‚Äúan apex predator.‚Äù A three-time failed congressional candidate, he has risen from the fringes of the online conspiracy community to become one of the most prominent voices in right-wing media, leveraging online platforms, as well as appearances on Fox News, to push wild conspiracy theories about the agency he will now help to oversee and about the government generally. (He has written a book called  Follow the Money: The Shocking Deep State Connections of the Anti-Trump Cabal .) A claimed proponent of free speech, Bongino is  prone to rants   and tirades  against anyone who criticizes him, and he  regularly blocks his critics  on social media. ‚ÄúDan Bongino is a Trump sycophant whose focus has been delegitimizing any and all legal steps taken against the president and his allies,‚Äù Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at media watchdog Media Matters who has tracked Bongino‚Äôs career closely, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúBongino‚Äôs appointment hammers home that Trump is building a federal law enforcement team that will carry out his desires to punish his political enemies: You don‚Äôt select a bomb-throwing podcaster who has declared that ‚Äòowning the libs‚Äô is his sole focus in life to help run the FBI if you‚Äôre aiming for an impartial bureau.‚Äù Bongino served full-time in the NYPD from 1997 to 1999 before joining the Secret Service. He left in 2011 to pursue a political career, running for Senate as a Republican in Maryland in 2012. At the time, his opinion of his former employer was still very positive. ‚ÄúThe president was a wonderful guy,‚Äù Bongino said of Obama in 2011. ‚ÄúFrom what I saw he was a wonderful father and a wonderful man and he was very, very nice and very kind to me.‚Äù In a memoir published in 2013, Bongino added that Obama was ‚Äúone of a group of men I would have gladly sacrificed my life for.‚Äù Around the same time, though, Bongino began to take his first steps on a path that would ultimately lead him to becoming one of the biggest podcasters in the US. In 2013 he appeared on Infowars, where he spoke to Alex Jones about the then recent shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. After Jones said it‚Äôs ‚Äúso over-the-top how authoritarian the Democrats have become‚Äù in response to school shootings, Bongino replied that Democrats aren‚Äôt crisis managers but are instead ‚Äúcrisis-leveraging [and] using a national emotional crisis to get you to believe things that simply aren‚Äôt true.‚Äù A decade later Jones would be ordered by a court to liquidate his assets to pay the families of the victims of the shooting $1.5 billion. Bongino made multiple appearances on Jones‚Äô show in the run-up to his second failed congressional tilt in 2014, this time losing to incumbent Democratic representative John Delaney in Maryland‚Äôs 6th Congressional District. During one of his Infowars appearances, Bongino boosted the conspiracy theory that CIA agents were told to stand down during the terrorist attacks on the US Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya. Bongino began his own podcast,  The Dan Bongino Show , in 2015, and a year later made his third attempt at winning a seat in Congress, this time in Florida‚Äôs 19th Congressional District. Just a week before the vote, Bongino was recorded having a full-on meltdown while speaking to a reporter from Politico, whom he called ‚Äú a real disgusting piece of shit .‚Äù In 2018 Bongino was handed his own 30-minute show on the National Rifle Association‚Äôs station, NRATV. Bongino used his show to continuously hammer the work being conducted by special counsel‚Äîand former FBI director‚ÄîRobert Mueller, who was at the time investigating Trump and allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Bongino pushed the conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign was being spied on, a situation he dubbed ‚Äúspygate‚Äù and called ‚Äúthe biggest scandal in American history.‚Äù During one show, discussing the pushback against the nomination of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Bongino said, ‚ÄúMy entire life right now is about owning the libs. That‚Äôs it. The libs ‚Ä¶ have shown themselves through this Kavanaugh abomination of a process to be ‚Ä¶ pure unadulterated evil.‚Äù His robust defense of Trump caught the attention of producers at Fox, who booked him hundreds of times during this period, and it appears to be at this point that Trump first took notice of Bongino. In June 2018, Trump quoted Bongino in two posts on Twitter after Bongino appeared on  Fox & Friends  slamming then CIA director John Brennan. Bongino connected with Trump, the Daily Beast reported in October 2018, writing that Trump spoke to his aides about ‚Äúmalicious influences inside the FBI,‚Äù  citing Bongino as the source of his information . Bongino‚Äôs NRATV show lasted less than a year, and in December 2018 when it was announced his show was ending,  Bongino reacted to critics  saying he had been fired and poking fun at his demise. A month later, Fox News signed Bongino as a contributor, despite the fact that he had been  reportedly barred from the set  of Shannon Bream‚Äôs show on the station for becoming ‚Äúunglued‚Äù during a recording. In 2021, Bongino became a Fox News host, with a Saturday night show called  Unfiltered , which he used to become one of the loudest voices pushing election-denial conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. He also used the platform to push  the great replacement conspiracy theory  and Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Bongino regularly railed against what he considered to be government overreach in relation to  mask and vaccine mandates . During the attack on the Capitol, Bongino was temporarily suspended from Twitter for posting a video originally shared by Trump, and in the days after the attack he  raged  about the decision to remove the messaging app Parler, in which he was an investor, from app stores. In 2022, YouTube finally took action against Bongino, who used to post his podcast on the platform, permanently banning him for spreading Covid-19 disinformation. However  Facebook continued to allow him  to use its platform, where he had built up a massive audience, to promote his conspiracy theories. Bongino left Fox News in 2023, but he has continued to grow his podcast on the alternative video streaming site Rumble, to which Vice President JD Vance has ties and in which he is an investor. While Bongino has not been as vocal a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory as his boss,  he has boosted QAnon figures  in the past, and his supporters on pro-Trump and conspiracy channels have been cheering his new role. These supporters claim that he and Patel will finally unmask the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù‚Äîa supposed group of government officials they believe have been waging a secret war on Trump. ‚ÄúTrump has brought together the dream team, the Avengers,‚Äù one prominent QAnon promoter wrote. ‚ÄúGet your popcorn ready.‚Äù Update 2/24/25 5:53pm ET: This story has been updated with additional information about the FBI Agents Association's view of the Bongino appointment.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-infowars/"},

As Musk and his so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force dismantle  key parts of the government  and plan to cut the workforce at federal agencies by half or more, the Millers have become pivotal figures in Musk‚Äôs orbit, multiple sources tell WIRED. The couple has been tasked as intermediaries, bringing news about Musk‚Äôs latest targets and communications strategies to the rest of the White House, say members of Trump‚Äôs inner circle and people outside the administration who know them personally. Just over a month into the new administration, they have been privately projecting themselves as two pairs of steady hands at the till. Stephen Miller is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser; two sources described his current role as that of a prime minister. His wife, Katie Miller, is a special government employee who functions as the top communications official at DOGE. She is also on the payroll of the firm P2 Public Affairs,  The Wall Street Journal  reported, which has ties to Musk and several alumni of Florida governor Ron DeSantis‚Äô 2024 presidential campaign. Stephen was a senior adviser in Trump‚Äôs first term, and an  architect  of the administration‚Äôs anti-immigration platform, including  advocating fo r the policy of separating migrant children from their families. Katie served in the first Trump administration as deputy press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security during Kirstjen Nielsen‚Äôs tenure before ascending to the role of press secretary in 2019 and communications director in 2020 for then-vice president Mike Pence. The Millers were married in 2020. Katie Miller, like many people associated with DOGE, is, as a special government employee, limited to working in the federal government for no more than 130 days in any given 365-day period and subject to less stringent ethics requirements than permanent employees. She was assigned to run communications for Musk prior to the transition, a White House official tells WIRED, beginning her journey with Musk as a ‚Äúcomms sherpa.‚Äù Now she has become the richest man in the world‚Äôs guide to life in Washington and integral to the high-velocity, high-volume barrage of cuts to the government‚Äôs workforce and spending‚Äîmany of them being questioned in the courts as to their legality‚Äîthat have come to dominate Trump‚Äôs first month back in office. Her relationship with Musk, the White House official says, is central to DOGE‚Äôs interactions with the rest of the White House. She‚Äôs the key intermediary, delivering the DOGE message of the day to the rest of the administration. She‚Äôs also the one to deliver any sensitive or bad news to Musk, says the official. The Republicans who spoke to WIRED for this story all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. They are all generally supportive of the DOGE initiatives but share varying degrees of concern about Musk harming Trump‚Äôs image and felt compelled to speak up out of an urge to protect the boss. (Trump, meanwhile, has continued to back Musk publicly with enthusiastic praise for DOGE‚Äôs cuts, most recently with a flattering introduction before Musk held court at Wednesday‚Äôs cabinet meeting.) Meanwhile, Stephen Miller has, along with Project 2025 coauthor and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, became one of  Musk‚Äôs closest allies  in the administration, The New York Times reported earlier this month. WIRED has learned that the relationship is far closer, and more complicated, than has been previously known publicly. In many ways, Musk‚Äôs targeting of federal agencies is perfectly in sync with the aims of Miller, who has championed DOGE‚Äôs work internally and even helped in making a lot of it possible. (In public, Miller has  equated  federal workers with ‚Äúradical left Communists‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal cartels.‚Äù) Still, sources tell WIRED that Trumpworld is more comfortable with Musk taking the heat for the recent federal cuts rather than the less famous‚Äîand, in their view, far less telegenic‚ÄîMiller. Yet through their actions so far, the Millers and Musk have developed a MAGA version of the Pet Shop Boys adage from the song ‚ÄúOpportunities (Let‚Äôs Make Lots of Money)‚Äù:  You‚Äôve got the brawn / I‚Äôve got the brains.  Stephen Miller‚Äôs knowledge of the federal apparatus, Katie Miller‚Äôs contacts on Capitol Hill, and the couple‚Äôs good standing among Trump loyalists, coupled with Musk‚Äôs relentless ambition and effectively infinite resources, made the scale of the DOGE government takeover possible. Musk is not the independent actor he‚Äôs often portrayed as and taken to be, in other words, but is rather carrying out actions essentially in concert with the man to whom the president has delegated much of the day-to-day work of governance. ‚ÄúStephen is kind of the prime minister,‚Äù one of three Republicans close to Trump and familiar with the situation tells WIRED. Another Republican familiar with the dynamic also used the term ‚ÄúPM‚Äù to describe Miller, short for prime minister. The implication is that Miller is carrying out the daily work of governance while Trump serves as head of state, focusing on the fun parts of being president. The White House did not answer questions about who reports to or outranks whom. The Millers are seen inside Trumpworld as glorified babysitters for Musk, tasked with ensuring he stays within bounds, insofar as that‚Äôs possible. ‚ÄúHe gets a lot of grace,‚Äù the first Republican said of Musk. ‚ÄúMany people aren‚Äôt nervous, because Stephen Miller is deeply involved. And Katie.‚Äù This Republican compared Musk to a preteen child. The involvement of the Millers is also one of the many reasons why Trumpworld sources say they now don‚Äôt currently see an implosion between Trump and Musk happening anytime soon even though, as  WIRED previously reported, rifts have already emerged  within the president‚Äôs inner circle over the centibillionaire‚Äôs level of power. Still, Musk‚Äôs relationship with the Millers has become a subject of great intrigue in Washington as DOGE continues to wreak havoc on the federal government. Little is known about how often they interact outside of work and how the relationship grew over the late stages of the campaign into the transition. ‚ÄúIf you can find out anything about Stephen Miller‚Äôs social life, I don‚Äôt wanna know the answer,‚Äù says a longtime Republican operative who knows the couple personally. ‚ÄúStephen and Katie are very attentive to [Musk],‚Äù the Republican who referred to Stephen as ‚Äúprime minister‚Äù tells WIRED. There‚Äôs also only one audience which truly matters, they say: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a forgiving audience: the audience of one, and all of us around him.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/katie-stephen-miller-elon-musk-takeover/"},

USAID Cuts Have Slowed the Response", "intro": "No intro", "date": "2025-03-03T14:47:11-05:00", "body": "Consequences of the  United States rapidly  slashing  foreign aid are  reverberating  across the world, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an  unidentified illness  with Ebola-like symptoms has ravaged several villages. This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC. Experts say that Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks. ‚ÄúMedical staff along the Uganda‚ÄìDRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,‚Äù says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC. Nidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the in-country presence,‚Äù she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. ‚ÄúOnce a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.‚Äù By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill. The US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. ‚ÄúCDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,‚Äù says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble. While the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization  now suspects  that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections  combined with malaria . Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  hypothesize  that this may be the case again. In 2024, the United States Congress  appropriated  $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections. Nevertheless, DOGE directed the swift dismantling of the vast majority of this aid. ‚ÄúHalting the US programs that prevent and treat malaria will lead to outbreaks and an exponential increase in deaths,‚Äù Martin Edlund, CEO of the nonprofit Malaria No More, said in  a statement . ‚ÄúNew  modeling  shows that a year of disruptions would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases of malaria and 107,000 additional deaths.‚Äù Whatever the cause of this particular outbreak of illness and death, the muzzled response stands in stark contrast to the critical assistance USAID would have provided had the outbreak occurred last year. Previously, the agency has also been a linchpin of the DRC‚Äôs overall public health response‚Äî according to  the US Embassy in Kinshasa, US health activities saved 11 million lives in 2024 alone ‚Äúfor diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria.‚Äù Getting rid of USAID has demolished a pillar of international infectious disease response that will be difficult to replace, experts say, even if Trump‚Äôs administration and  DOGE  were to decide tomorrow that lifesaving humanitarian aid with  minimal impact  on the federal budget and major  national security benefits  is worthwhile after all. USAID, established over 60 years ago, was slashed and burned in under two months. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt rebuild a structure so quickly when you have fully burned it to the ground,‚Äù Bouri says. The breadth of the destruction of USAID‚Äôs lifesaving work was underlined by the agency‚Äôs acting assistant administrator for global health, Nicholas Enrich, in an internal memo viewed by WIRED and sent on February 28. (Enrich was  placed on leave  after issuing the memo.) ‚ÄúThe Bureau for Global Health has been wholly prevented from delivering life-saving activities under the waiver to date,‚Äù the memo says, describing in detail how the humanitarian waivers administered by the State Department have not worked in practice, and claiming that acting USAID head Pete Marocco refused to sign off on a plan to give the WHO previously agreed-upon access to ‚Äúa critical stockpile of PPE and lab supplies‚Äù to support the current Ebola outbreak in Uganda. This confirms  earlier reporting  from WIRED about how the Ebola response remained botched despite Musk‚Äôs assertions that DOGE had ‚Äúfixed‚Äù mistakes it had made with Ebola personnel. Disease and illness do not yield to the concept of borders, and an outbreak in one country can easily become an outbreak in another. Covid-19, which originated in China, quickly impacted every nation. While hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola remain rare in the United States, one reason why the US has a national interest in monitoring and containing these and other illnesses is to guard against them spreading into the country. ‚ÄúThere are many places in the world which are prone to outbreaks where people can come to the US within one to two flights,‚Äù Bouri says. ‚ÄúIt does not take a long time for a virus to come in.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/race-to-identify-drcs-mystery-illness-slowed-by-us-aid-cuts-democratic-republic-congo-usaid/"},

This email was signed by Scott Langmack, who identified himself as a senior adviser to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Langmack, according to his LinkedIn, already has another job: He‚Äôs the chief operating officer of Kukun, a property technology company that is, according to its  website , ‚Äúon a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.‚Äù As is the case with other DOGE operatives‚ÄîTom Krause, for example, is performing the duties of the fiscal assistant secretary at the Treasury while  holding down a day job as a software CEO  at a company with  millions in contracts with the Treasury ‚Äîthis could potentially create a conflict of interest, especially given a specific aspect of his role: According to sources and government documents reviewed by WIRED, Langmack has application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside HUD, one of which contains records mapping billions of dollars in expenditures. Another DOGE operative WIRED has identified is Michael Mirski, who works for TCC Management, a Michigan-based company that owns and operates mobile home parks across the US, and graduated from the Wharton School in 2014. (In a  story  he wrote for the school‚Äôs website, he asserted that the most important thing he learned there was to ‚ÄúDevelop the infrastructure to collect data.‚Äù) According to the documents, he has write privileges on‚Äîmeaning he can input overall changes to‚Äîa system that controls who has access to HUD systems. Between them, records reviewed by WIRED show, the DOGE operatives have access to five different HUD systems. According to a HUD source with direct knowledge, this gives the DOGE operatives access to vast troves of data. These range from the individual identities of every single federal public housing voucher holder in the US, along with their financial information, to information on the hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily housing, and senior living facilities that HUD helps finance, as well as data on everything from homelessness rates to environmental and health hazards to federally insured mortgages. Put together, experts and HUD sources say, all of this could give someone with access unique insight into the US real estate market. Kukun did not respond to requests for comment about whether Langmack is drawing a salary while working at HUD or how long he will be with the department. A woman who answered the phone at TCC Management headquarters in Michigan but did not identify herself said Mirksi was \"on leave until July.\" In response to a request for comment about Langmack‚Äôs access to systems, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said, ‚ÄúDOGE and HUD are working as a team; to insinuate anything else is false. To further illustrate this unified mission, the secretary established a HUD DOGE taskforce.‚Äù In response to specific questions about Mirski‚Äôs access to systems and background and qualifications, she said, ‚ÄúWe have not‚Äîand will not‚Äîcomment on individual personnel. We are focused on serving the American people and working as one team.‚Äù The property technology,  or proptech, market covers a wide range of companies offering products and services meant to, for example, automate tenant-landlord interactions, or expedite the home purchasing process. Kukun focuses on helping homeowners and real estate investors assess the return on investment they‚Äôd get from renovating their properties and on predictive analytics that model where property values will rise in the future. Doing this kind of estimation requires the use of what‚Äôs called an automated valuation model (AVM), a machine-learning model that predicts the prices or rents of certain properties. In April 2024,  Kukun was one of eight companies  selected to receive support from REACH, an accelerator run by the venture capital arm of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Last year NAR  agreed to a settlement  with Missouri homebuyers, who alleged that realtor fees and certain listing requirements were anticompetitive. ‚ÄúIf you can better predict than others how a certain neighborhood will develop, you can invest in that market,‚Äù says Fabian Braesemann, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Doing so requires data, access to which can make any machine-learning model more accurate and more monetizable. This is the crux of the potential conflict of interest: While it is unclear how Langmack and Mirski are using or interpreting it in their roles at HUD, what is clear is that they have access to a wide range of sensitive data. According to employees at HUD who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, there is currently a six-person DOGE team operating within the department. Four members are HUD employees whose tenures predate the current administration and have been assigned to the group; the others are Mirski and Langmack. The records reviewed by WIRED show that Mirski has been given read and write access to three different HUD systems, as well as read-only access to two more, while Langmack has been given read and write access to two of HUD‚Äôs core systems. A positive, from one source‚Äôs perspective, is the fact that the DOGE operatives have been given application-level access to the systems, rather than direct access to the databases themselves. In theory, this means that they can only interact with the data through user interfaces, rather than having direct access to the server, which could allow them to execute queries directly on the database or make unrestricted or irreparable changes. However, this source still sees dangers inherent in granting this level of access. ‚ÄúThere are probably a dozen-plus ways that [application-level] read/write access to WASS or LOCCS could be translated into the entire databases being exfiltrated,‚Äù they said. There is no specific reason to think that DOGE operatives have inappropriately moved data‚Äîbut even the possibility cuts against standard security protocols that HUD sources say are typically in place.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18 or davidgilbert.01. LOCCS, or Line of Credit Control System, is the first system to which both DOGE operatives within HUD, according to the records reviewed by WIRED, have both read and write access. Essentially HUD‚Äôs banking system, LOCCS ‚Äúhandles disbursement and cash management for the majority of HUD grant programs,‚Äù according to a  user guide . Billions of dollars flow through the system every year, funding everything from public housing to disaster relief‚Äîsuch as rebuilding from the recent LA wildfires‚Äîto food security programs and rent payments. The current balance in the LOCCS system, according to a record reviewed by WIRED, is over $100 billion‚Äîmoney Congress has approved for HUD projects but which has yet to be drawn down. Much of this money has been earmarked to cover disaster assistance and community development work, a source at the agency says. Normally, those who have access to LOCCS require additional processing and approvals to access the system, and most only have ‚Äúread‚Äù access, department employees say. ‚ÄúRead/write is used for executing contracts and grants on the LOCCS side,‚Äù says one person. ‚ÄúIt normally has strict banking procedures around doing anything with funds. For instance, you usually need at least two people to approve any decisions‚Äîsame as you would with bank tellers in a physical bank.‚Äù The second system to which documents indicate both DOGE operatives at HUD have both read and write access is the HUD Central Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS), an ‚Äúintegrated management system for Section 8 programs under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public and Indian Housing,‚Äù  according  to HUD. (Section 8 is a federal program administered through local housing agencies that provides rental assistance, in the form of vouchers, to  millions of lower-income families .) This system was a precursor to LOCCS and is currently being phased out, but it is still being used to process the payment of housing vouchers and contains huge amounts of personal information. There are currently  2.3 million families in receipt of housing vouchers  in the US, according to HUD‚Äôs own data, but the HUDCAPS database contains information on significantly more individuals because historical data is retained, says a source familiar with the system. People applying for HUD programs like housing vouchers have to submit sensitive personal information, including medical records and personal narratives. ‚ÄúPeople entrust these stories to HUD,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not data in these systems, it‚Äôs operational trust.‚Äù WASS, or the  Web Access Security Subsystem , is the third system to which DOGE has both read and write access, though only Mirski has access to this system according to documents reviewed by WIRED. It‚Äôs used to grant permissions to other HUD systems. ‚ÄúMost of the functionality in WASS consists of looking up information stored in various tables to tell the security subsystem who you are, where you can go, and what you can do when you get there,‚Äù a  user manual  says. ‚ÄúWASS is an application for provisioning rights to most if not all other HUD systems,‚Äù says a HUD source familiar with the systems who is shocked by Mirski‚Äôs level of access, because normally HUD employees don‚Äôt have read access, let alone write access. ‚ÄúWASS is the system for setting permissions for all of the other systems.‚Äù In addition to these three systems, documents show that Mirski has read-only access to two others. One, the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS), is a nationwide database that tracks all HUD programs underway across the country. (‚ÄúIDIS has confidential data about hidden locations of domestic violence shelters,‚Äù a HUD source says, ‚Äúso even read access in there is horrible.‚Äù) The other is the Financial Assessment of Public Housing (FASS-PH), a database designed to ‚Äúmeasure the financial condition of public housing agencies and assess their ability to provide safe and decent housing,‚Äù according to HUD‚Äôs website. All of this  is significant because, in addition to the potential for privacy violations, knowing what is in the records, or even having access to them, presents a serious potential conflict of interest. ‚ÄúThere are often bids to contract any development projects,‚Äù says Erin McElroy, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. ‚ÄúI can imagine having insider information definitely benefiting the private market, or those who will move back into the private market,‚Äù she alleges. HUD has an oversight role in the mobile home space, the area on which TCC Management, which appears to have recently wiped its website, focuses. \"It‚Äôs been a growing area of HUD‚Äôs work and focus over the past few decades,\" says one source there; this includes setting building standards, inspecting factories, and taking in complaints. This presents another potential conflict of interest. Braesemann says it‚Äôs not just the insider access to information and data that could be a potential problem, but that people coming from the private sector may not understand the point of HUD programs. Something like Section 8 housing, he notes, could be perceived as not working in alignment with market forces‚Äî‚ÄúBecause there might be higher real estate value, these people should be displaced and go somewhere else‚Äù‚Äîeven though its purpose is specifically to buffer against the market. Like other government agencies, HUD is facing mass purges of its workforce. NPR has  reported  that 84 percent of the staff of the Office of Community Planning and Development, which supports homeless people, faces termination, while the president of a union representing HUD workers has  estimated  that up to half the workforce could be cut The chapter on housing policy in Project 2025‚Äîthe right-wing playbook to remake the federal government that the Trump administration appears to be following‚Äîoutlines plans to massively scale back HUD programs like  public housing, housing assistance vouchers, and first-time home buyer assistance .

Two times a day, the embassy automatically published current  pollution levels  measured by an air quality monitor installed on its roof in collaboration with the US Environmental Protection Agency. The data contradicted the figures published by the local government, angering local officials and eventually spurring China to clean up the air in its capital city. But on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the US State Department told WIRED that the program is abruptly ending due to budget constraints. The project eventually became part of a broader, highly successful US government initiative known officially as DOSAir, which measured pollution levels in about 80 cities where US diplomatic missions are located around the world. Scientists and researchers have credited it with helping clean up the air in dozens of countries, preventing up to 895 premature deaths and saving $465 million in medical costs per median city annually, according to  a research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2022 . For now, individual embassies can still run their air monitors, the State Department spokesperson said, but they will no longer send data back to the agency. Historical statistics will continue to be available online, but there‚Äôs no estimated date when real-time data transmissions will resume, they added. ‚ÄúIn many countries where these instruments were placed, it was the first air quality data ever,‚Äù says Daniel Westervelt, a research professor at Columbia University‚Äôs Climate School‚Äôs Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ‚ÄúThat going away is going to hinder research and hinder the advancement of our understanding of the exposure of air pollutants to human health.‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a current or former US government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zeyiyang.06. Sixteen years ago, when the US embassy began sharing air quality data in Beijing, Twitter had not yet been blocked in China. Graham Webster, a research scholar at Stanford who lived in the country at the time, remembers seeing tweets from the US Embassy occasionally go viral when its pollution monitoring bot designated the air quality in the city as ‚Äúcrazy bad,‚Äù indicating a hazardous pollutant known as PM2.5 had reached extremely high levels. The State Department program soon became a source for data that challenged the official air quality reports released by the Chinese government. ‚ÄúIt allowed the Chinese public to view a comparison between the outside observers and the official statistics,‚Äù Webster says. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an example of how good, quality data that people trust can make things difficult for a political regime where information is tightly controlled.‚Äù At first, the local government in Beijing fervently opposed the initiative. At one point, the Chinese deputy minister of environmental protection  publicly called  the American air quality readings unlawful and  said  the US was ‚Äúintervening in China's domestic affairs.‚Äù But even though Beijing officials publicly opposed it, a former US diplomat who ran the air quality monitoring program in its early years tells WIRED that many of them expressed appreciation for the program behind closed doors, because it gave them information they could use to protect their own health, too. (They asked to remain anonymous because they weren‚Äôt authorized to speak to the media.) The State Department‚Äôs air quality program eventually became an example of a smart, efficient diplomacy that boosted American soft power while bringing about real-world changes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen an initiative of the US government have such an immediate, dramatic impact in a country,‚Äù Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China, told the Washington Post back in 2013. The project was so successful that it was featured on the website of  the National Museum of American Diplomacy . Before it was suddenly killed, State Department officials, researchers, and the public could view the international air quality data collected from US embassies on AirNow, a database maintained by the EPA, as well as on ZephAir, an app designed by the State Department to help US diplomats abroad. The  former webpage  has been made unavailable; the app showed that at least half a dozen embassies stopped reporting regular data in the middle of Tuesday before the function was completely disabled on Wednesday, according to tests performed by WIRED. Westervelt, who describes the DOSAir as ‚Äúa bedrock of international air quality work,‚Äù says he previously received grants from the State Department to help expand the program in Africa. He says he became worried about its fate when he learned last week that his grants had been terminated along with  thousands of others  at the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development. Diplomatic Triumph By the end of 2011, the air monitoring program was having its big moment of public recognition in China. Pollution got so bad in Beijing that the city had to close its airport. The State Department‚Äôs bot was blasting ‚Äúcrazy bad‚Äù readings on Twitter again, but the official Chinese government figures said the air was only ‚Äúslightly polluted.‚Äù The Chinese public, however, decided to trust the US embassy‚Äôs number. Many people voiced their disappointment on social media and pushed the government to take action to clean up the air. It became ‚Äúan environmental awakening akin to the London Fog,‚Äù says the former US diplomat. In a twist that‚Äôs almost incomprehensible today, the Chinese government even officially adopted the US State Department‚Äôs method for reporting air quality. It also made significant efforts to clean up air pollution, and collaborated with the EPA on climate and environmental issues. The DOSAir program was welcomed in many other countries as well, especially those that didn‚Äôt have an existing infrastructure to collect air quality data, says Westervelt. In some cases, local governments used the high-quality data collected at US embassies to calibrate readings on their own lower-cost air monitors. For these countries, ending support for the air quality monitoring program could hinder their progress cleaning up the air, says Westervelt. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really mitigate the air pollution problem unless you have quantitative evidence,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúLosing it is a pretty big blow.‚Äù Clear Economic Winner Over the past month, the Trump administration has slashed funding and staff across the federal government as part of a  cost-cutting initiative  led by Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But the air quality monitoring program isn‚Äôt very expensive for the US State Department to maintain. Westervelt estimates it costs just tens of thousands of dollars a year because most of the monitoring equipment has already been purchased, and the main expenses are associated with maintenance. The program demonstrated how relatively low-cost information technologies could be used to spur substantial reductions of air pollution, says Akshaya Jha, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who co-authored the 2022 study. When a US embassy began publishing the readings in a city, he says, it often raised public awareness about pollution and put pressure on the host country to take action to clean up the air. Jha found that local Google searches for the term ‚Äúair quality‚Äù steadily increased after monitors were installed. Air pollution levels, estimated by satellite measurements, also dropped. In the long run, Jha‚Äôs research also found that the program actually saves money for the State Department, which is required to pay diplomats extra compensation for living in more hazardous environments. ‚ÄúOur estimates indicate that the monitors save the median embassy roughly $34,000 a year in this kind of hardship payments,‚Äù Jha says. Even beyond the hardship compensation, creating a world where fewer people are dying from diseases linked to air pollution would reduce the need for things like costly medical treatments. ‚ÄúIn terms of benefits of this program relative to its costs, It‚Äôs a clear winner,‚Äù Jha says.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/air-monitoring-beijing-state-department-halted/"},

Over the previous night in Asia, the Donald Trump administration had abruptly announced it would end nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from the US State Department, including the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) as well as the  US Agency for International Development , representing about  90 percent  of USAID‚Äôs contracts overall. The announcement was the latest in a string of efforts by the Trump administration and Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to curtail foreign aid from the US, which has provided medical and humanitarian assistance to millions of people for decades. A letter sent from USAID to grantees viewed by WIRED instructed them to ‚Äúimmediately cease all activities, terminate all subawards and contracts,‚Äù and avoid incurring any additional expenses ‚Äúbeyond those unavoidable costs associated with this Termination Notice.‚Äù Several digital and human rights organizations who spoke to WIRED in Taipei‚Äîmost on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the Trump administration or their own governments‚Äîsay the cuts have undermined years of global democracy-building and free speech initiatives and put the lives and livelihoods of their staff around the world at risk. Many of the groups who were at RightsCon, one of the largest annual events centered on human rights and technology organized by the nonprofit Access Now, particularly focus on providing cybersecurity support for people like journalists, activists, and other vulnerable groups in authoritarian countries, like protecting against doxxing and hacking attacks meant to intimidate and silence them. Without USAID and State Department funding, that work will likely cease. ‚ÄúThe digital security ecosystem has collapsed totally for NGOs, totally,‚Äù says Mohammed Al-Maskati, director of Access Now‚Äôs digital security helpline, which offers free digital security help to journalists, activists, and civil society groups. Causing even further confusion, just days after the cancellations went out some organizations say they received notices that they were sent in error, according to correspondence reviewed by WIRED. It‚Äôs not clear how the Trump administration determined which grants and organizations would be spared. Nonprofit organizations that can keep their funding from the US government, however, will be subject to a new requirement: Their contracts now include a rider mandating they comply with an  anti-DEI executive order  that Trump signed in late January. It applies to all of an organization‚Äôs programs, even if they don‚Äôt all receive American support. Failure to follow the order may constitute a violation of the  false claims act , the Trump administration warned in materials reviewed by WIRED. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82. When WIRED initially reached out about the cancellations, a State Department representative said that ‚Äúeach program underwent a review with the goal of restructuring assistance to align with the administration's policy priorities. Programs that serve our nation‚Äôs interests will continue. However, programs that aren‚Äôt aligned with our national interest will not.‚Äù The State Department did not respond to follow-up questions about the reinstatement of certain grants. USAID did not respond to requests for comment. In a  post on X  on Monday, Musk asserted that ‚Äúno one has died as result of a brief pause to do a sanity check on foreign aid funding. No one.‚Äù He categorized DOGE‚Äôs work at the aid agency far more dramatically last month, boasting about having spent one weekend ‚Äú feeding USAID into the wood chipper .‚Äù One nonprofit worker whose organization supports projects in Asia says they were bewildered by the kinds of initiatives that were initially canceled at their organization, which were focused on helping groups resisting China‚Äôs authoritarian influence. That person told WIRED that the State Department representatives they were in contact with also seemed to be taken by surprise by the sudden revocation of the grants, some of which were later reversed. ‚ÄúThings are total chaos now,‚Äù the nonprofit worker says. A person familiar with US-funded projects in Venezuela that are designed to help people access news and information  censored  by the country's authoritarian ruler Nicol√°s Maduro says the funding cuts will render that work useless. ‚ÄúNow, all that money that was already spent in building these things will have gone to waste,‚Äù the person tells WIRED. Leaders in the Trump administration have harshly criticized the Maduro government in the past. Secretary of state Marco Rubio recently called Maduro a ‚Äú horrible dictator ‚Äù and repeatedly  championed US aid to Venezuela  while serving in the Senate. Last year,  Venezuela banned the social media platform X for 10 days  after Musk repeatedly attacked Maduro online. By the time the US funding contract terminations were announced, the mood this year at RightsCon was already tinged with anxiety and grief. Organizations impacted by the cuts rushed to attend hastily arranged closed-door meetings to swap information and strategize about how they would manage the fallout. Questions about how the human rights world should respond to the sudden and enormous funding gap also peppered many of the question-and-answer segments of speaker panels. One of the many recipients of the State Department‚Äôs DRL grants was Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, which supports journalists in places like Yemen and Libya, whose investigative work often puts them at risk of being harassed or killed. Rawan Damen, director of ARIJ, says the cuts represent about 20 percent of her organization‚Äôs budget, or about half a million dollars. ‚ÄúWe don't want to lay off people. We have a small team of 30 people that we have groomed over 20 years,‚Äù Dawen says, adding that replacing their expertise would be costly and very difficult. Damen says that the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a congressionally funded nonprofit that disburses grants to a variety of smaller organizations that promote democracy efforts globally, was also a key funder for ARIJ. On February 25, NED  announced  it was ‚Äúunable to access its congressionally appropriated funds‚Äù and therefore had to ‚Äúto halt all partner support and furlough the majority of its staff.‚Äù In many cases, organizations like those represented at RightsCon work with‚Äîand employ‚Äîmembers of particularly vulnerable populations, like religious minorities or members of the LGBTQ+ community. One nonprofit that spoke with WIRED said they prioritized hiring vulnerable workers, like Iranian asylum seekers, many of whom relied on employment with their organization to be able to remain safe in exile. US foreign aid, the vast majority of which flows through USAID, has been a  key target  of the Trump administration and DOGE‚Äôs stated efforts to shrink federal spending. (USAID represents less than 1 percent of the overall US federal budget and runs programs that  have been credited  with saving  millions of lives .) As Musk‚Äôs DOGE strike force has  gained access  to data systems at both USAID and the State Department, some nonprofit workers who spoke to WIRED said they feared that the cost-cutting group would be able to review‚Äîand share‚Äîsensitive information they had provided to the US as a condition of receiving foreign aid funding. Organizations working in high-risk countries, particularly those that receive money from the State Department, are required to submit to background checks on their staff and contractors that are verified against US law enforcement databases. ‚ÄúOur details are there. You're talking about loads of names of people that work with us from loads of different regions,‚Äù says another nonprofit employee who focuses on human rights in Iran. ‚ÄúThat's actually been a really big concern for the whole community, because [Musk] has been posting stuff, and he doesn't care about the safety or security of our people.‚Äù The data security fears are not entirely unfounded:  DOGE reportedly shared classified information  on its website when it launched, and the US Central Intelligence Agency also recently sent an  unclassified email  with the names of some employees to the White House to comply with the Trump administration‚Äôs orders to reduce the federal workforce. The US government, the nonprofit worker with projects in Asia said, has not been able to ‚Äúassure us that the data is anyway segregated and not being viewed by parties from DOGE, and effectively, that could result in someone's information being shared online in a way that would put them at immediate risk of imprisonment and death.‚Äù The same worker says they worry that DOGE and the Trump administration are creating an environment that makes operating as a US federal grantee very risky. With the new rider, organizations are now vulnerable to lawsuits over suspected DEI practices that could bankrupt them. Such allegations might be especially difficult to disprove for organizations working with groups like women, religious minorities, or queer people. But it‚Äôs not just US-sponsored organizations that are concerned about the new environment in which they find themselves. Access Now‚Äôs Al-Maskati says that entities based in the United States have also started to reach out for assistance, not necessarily for people they work with in other countries, but for their own staff at home, fearing that their workers will be harassed or targeted online. ‚ÄúBecause they do research about democracy,‚Äù he says.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/rights-con-taipei-doge-foreign-aid-cuts/"},

Hours later, 123 buildings, including high-profile sites like the J. Edgar Hoover Building and Veterans Administration buildings in Washington, DC, were removed from the list. By Wednesday, the entire list had disappeared from the GSA website. WIRED has created a map and a searchable table of the government properties that were for sale and briefly listed, which also includes corresponding political representatives for each location. WIRED cross-referenced two datasets to create the map: the list of ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù properties originally published‚Äîand then removed‚Äîby the GSA, and the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties (IOLP). The GSA defines non-core properties as buildings and facilities that are ‚Äúnot core to government operations‚Äù and in a press release about the list argued that sales would provide \"savings to the American taxpayer.\" The IOLP, a publicly accessible database, offers detailed information on GSA-owned and leased properties across the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. Among those originally denoted as for sale are historically significant properties like Chicago‚Äôs Ludwig Mies van der Rohe‚â†designed John C. Kluczynski Federal Building and the Custom House, an Art Deco building taking up a city block in Philadelphia‚Äôs Old City. Less prominent but still notable buildings include the Martinsburg Computing Center in Kearneysville, West Virginia, which houses what the IRS describes as its ‚Äúindividual and corporate tax administration master file data base,‚Äù and the  Central Heating Plant  in Washington, DC, which provides heated and chilled water to government buildings, museums, and national monuments. (The GSA has since claimed that not all buildings are for sale, but the agency has repeatedly changed its tune throughout different internal documents and communications to staffers.) The GSA, an independent government agency, manages government IT and a significant portion of the federal real estate portfolio. In recent weeks, the agency has been decimated by forced resignations and reductions in forces, including the elimination of 18F, a GSA unit focused on government efficiency. The GSA‚Äôs Public Buildings Service (PBS) is  reportedly  planning to cut 63 percent of its workforce, about 3,600 people in total. Elon Musk‚Äôs associates are staffed throughout the GSA, including Technology Transformation Services director Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer, and X staffer Nicole Hollander. A number of  young DOGE technologists  also have access to the agency. WIRED reported in February  that employees at the GSA were told to sell off more than 500 federal buildings, including properties that house government agencies and the offices of US senators. The list of these buildings divided the properties into ‚Äúcore‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù assets and designated the ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù assets as to be sold. A note on the original list states that the agency‚Äôs intention is eventually to reduce the ‚Äúsize of the owned real estate footprint by 50 percent and the number of buildings by 70 percent. Reductions will be focused on the non-core general office space of the portfolio which can be replaced as needed in the private leased market. Moving forward, all non-core buildings will be disposed of and their tenants will be transitioned into leases.‚Äù Got a Tip?

The GSA has not said why it published and then subsequently removed the list. ‚ÄúSome have suggested [the list was taken down] due to the negative press,‚Äù says a source at GSA, who, along with others mentioned in this story, WIRED is granting anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press. ‚ÄúThere has been no national strategy on how GSA is supposed to engage customer agencies on their occupancy agreements in these buildings.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur portfolio [team] haven‚Äôt heard anything from our national office on what‚Äôs actually going on,‚Äù another source says. Other sources have described a small group at the GSA, walled off from other employees, making decisions in tandem with DOGE. ‚ÄúThe thing you need to realize is the administrator [of the GSA] and PBS commissioner are making these decisions in a vacuum,‚Äù says a source, referring to Michael Peters, the recently appointed PBS commissioner, and Stephen Ehikian, the acting GSA administrator. ‚ÄúThe regional staff, senior regional leadership, and most GSA national office staff don‚Äôt get to talk to the administrator or PBS commissioner. They have a floor locked off at GSA headquarters with elevator access restricted. They‚Äôre in there with DOGE reps ‚Ä¶ I know it sounds like a bad James Bond movie or I‚Äôm making it up, but they literally have locked off a floor.‚Äù Peters and Ehikian did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The link to the list published to the GSA website has been replaced by a page that says ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are identifying buildings and facilities that are not core to government operations, or non-core properties, for disposal,‚Äù the page states. ‚ÄúSelling ensures that taxpayer dollars are no longer spent on vacant or underutilized federal spaces. Disposing of these assets helps eliminate costly maintenance and allows us to reinvest in high-quality work environments that support agency missions.‚Äù In a Wednesday press statement, the GSA did not clarify why the list was deleted. ‚ÄúTo be clear, just because an asset is on the list doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immediately for sale,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúHowever, we will consider compelling offers (in accordance with applicable laws and regulations) and do what's best for the needs of the federal government and taxpayer.‚Äù The agency added, ‚ÄúWe anticipate the list will be republished in the near future after we evaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.‚Äù The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, emailed employees about the list of buildings and noted that a number of its buildings were identified as ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù assets. ‚ÄúCMS was not aware this was happening, and we didn‚Äôt submit or approve any of our current office locations being on this list,‚Äù the email states. ‚ÄúWe are in active discussions with HHS to ensure we have the facilities we need to fully return to the office in-person and continue performing our critical mission.‚Äù Sources tell WIRED that the posting of the list yesterday has resulted in chaos at the GSA. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason we have processes, and they just don‚Äôt follow them,‚Äù one source says. ‚ÄúAmateur hour,‚Äù says another source.

Officials at the Army‚Äôs Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)‚Äîthe major command responsible for training soldiers, developing leaders, and shaping the service‚Äôs guidelines, strategies, and concepts‚Äîare currently using the AI tool, dubbed CamoGPT, to ‚Äúreview policies, programs, publications, and initiatives for DEIA and report findings,‚Äù according to an internal memo reviewed by WIRED. The memo followed Trump‚Äôs signing of a January 27  executive order  titled ‚ÄúRestoring America‚Äôs Fighting Force,‚Äù which directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to eliminate all Pentagon policies seen as promoting what that the commander in chief declared ‚Äúun-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories‚Äù regarding race and gender, a  linguistic dragnet  that extends as far as  past social media posts  from official US military accounts. In an email to WIRED, TRADOC spokesman Army Major Chris Robinson confirmed the use of CamoGPT to review DEIA materials. TRADOC ‚Äúwill fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the Executive Orders issued by the president. We ensure that these directives are carried out with the utmost professionalism, efficiency, and in alignment with national security objectives,‚Äù Robinson says. ‚ÄúSpecific details about internal policies and tactics cannot be discussed. However, the use of all tools in our portfolio, including CamoGPT, to increase productivity at all levels can and will be used.‚Äù Developed last summer to boost productivity and operational readiness across the US Army, CamoGPT currently has around 4,000 users who ‚Äúinteract‚Äù with it on a daily basis, Captain Aidan Doyle, a CamoGPT data engineer, tells WIRED. The tool is used for everything from developing comprehensive training program materials to producing multilingual translations, with TRADOC  providing  a ‚Äúproof of concept and demonstration‚Äù at last October‚Äôs annual Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC, according to Robinson. While Doyle declined to comment on the specifics on how TRADOC officials were likely using the CamoGPT to scan for DEIA-related policies, he described the process of searching through documents as relatively straightforward. ‚ÄúI would take all the documentation you want to examine, order it all in a collection on CamoGPT, and then ask questions about the documents,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe way retrieval-augmented generation works is that the more specific your question is to the concepts inside the document, the more detailed information the model will provide back.‚Äù In practical terms, this means that TRADOC officials are likely inputting a large number of documents into CamoGPT and asking the LLM to scan for targeted keywords like ‚Äúdignity‚Äù or ‚Äúrespect‚Äù (which, yes, the Army is  currently using  to screen past digital content) to identify materials for subsequent alteration and bring them in line with Trump‚Äôs executive order. By using CamoGPT, the work of eliminating DEIA-related content will likely result in a rapid change to the US Army‚Äôs documentation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre competing with ‚Äòcontrol+F‚Äô in Adobe Acrobat,‚Äù Doyle says. CamoGPT isn‚Äôt the only AI chatbot in the Pentagon‚Äôs arsenal: The US Air Force‚Äôs NIPRGPT has seen extensive use among airmen since its launch in June for ‚Äúsummarization of documents, drafting of documents and coding assistance,‚Äù  according  to DefenseScoop. The AI-assisted assessment of US military training materials comes amid a government-wide effort to root out DEIA  initiated  the day Trump returned to the Oval Office in January to start his second term.  Detailed  in Trump‚Äôs January 27 executive order, the Defense Department‚Äôs purge has taken the form of the closure of service-specific DEIA offices and program, a department-wide review of past DEI initiatives, and even the removal of historical content related to the famed all-Black Tuskegee Airmen from Air Force basic training materials, the latter of which was  swiftly reversed  amid public outcry. Originally inspired by the public release of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT in November 2022, CamoGPT is a product of the Army‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C), the organization formed in 2018 as part of Army Future Command to spearhead AI research and development efforts by ‚Äúleveraging a soldier workforce to build experimental prototypes,‚Äù as Eric Schmitz, AI2C‚Äôs operations and intelligence portfolio lead, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThe mission is to make AI accessible to the Army through experimentation, and we have an ethos and culture that is very much a start-up ethos.‚Äù Schmitz says. ‚ÄúWe are product-centric and believe AI is inherently software-driven: You can do all the research you like in academia, but if you don't have software to deliver it to somebody and find out if it's useful software, then you‚Äôll never know if your AI is useful in the real world.‚Äù In response to the arrival of ChatGPT, AI2C quickly spun up a CamoGPT prototype based on an open-source LLM in June 2024. The center‚Äôs approach to CamoGPT is ‚Äúmodel agnostic,‚Äù according to Schmitz: While the system currently relies on tech giant Meta‚Äôs open-source Llama 3.3 70B LLM, the underlying model is ‚Äúexpendable‚Äù should a better version hit the market. What really matters is building software that the average soldier will actually use in their day-to-day operations, an achievement that might influence its long-term adoption across the force. ‚ÄúWhen you talk about how the Army doesn‚Äôt build software well, it‚Äôs because user adoption is not a priority, but it‚Äôs a massive priority to us,‚Äù Schmitz says. Whether CamoGPT proliferates more broadly across the Army remains to be seen, and Schmitz and Doyle emphasized that AI2C‚Äôs role is laser-focused on experimental prototyping rather than building products ready for immediate fielding. But with the entire federal government reorienting itself in the name of ‚Äú efficiency ,‚Äù the success of CamoGPT‚Äôs application to Trump‚Äôs DEIA overhaul may end up cementing its utility for military planners. ‚ÄúYou need to be ruthlessly critical of what you have built and what you plan to build and hyper focused on driving user adoption,‚Äù Schmitz says. ‚ÄúThe core question is, how do you build something that‚Äôs so valuable that people say they can't live without it?‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-army-is-using-camogpt-to-purge-dei-from-training-materials/"},

Business leaders can secure a one-on-one meeting with the president at Mar-a-Lago for $5 million, according to sources with direct knowledge of the meetings. At a so-called candlelight dinner held as recently as this past Saturday, prospective Mar-a-Lago guests were asked to spend $1 million to reserve a seat, according to an invitation obtained by WIRED. ‚ÄúYou are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest President Donald J. Trump,‚Äù the invitation reads, under a ‚ÄúMAGA INC.‚Äù header. MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump‚Äôs 2024 presidential campaign. ‚ÄúAdditional details provided upon RSVP. RSVPs will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis. Space is very limited. $1,000,000 per person.‚Äù Invitees were asked to RSVP to Meredith O‚ÄôRourke, who served as national finance director and senior adviser at Donald J. Trump for President 2024, a campaign committee, and who is the owner of The O‚ÄôRourke Group, which O‚ÄôRourke describes on her LinkedIn page as a ‚ÄúRepublican political fundraiser.‚Äù Invitees were also directed to email Abby Mathis, the finance coordinator at MAGA Inc. Mathis was previously a staff assistant for Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama‚Äîa former Auburn University football coach‚Äîand also served as an intern at the White House office of the staff secretary, according to LegiStorm, a research organization that posts information on politicians and their staffers. O‚ÄôRourke and Mathis did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. The invitation specifically states that ‚ÄúDonald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a featured speaker, and is not asking for funds or donations.‚Äù The event occurred at 7 pm on March 1 and was listed on the  president‚Äôs official schedule  as the ‚ÄúMAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.‚Äù This is the only event by that name on Trump‚Äôs official schedule since he took office. Michael Solakiewicz, a pro-Trump digital creator, posted photographs of the event on Instagram. WIRED has also viewed photographs and videos of  Elon Musk  with his son X at Mar-a-Lago the following day during a  charity event  hosted by a group called Wine Women & Shoes that also featured Trump.

The source pointed specifically to the tech sector, where executives have scrambled to show fealty to the new administration. While X owner Elon Musk notably spent at least  $260 million  to elect Trump, other tech  companies  and  executives  collectively donated millions to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos, Meta, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Uber, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all donated $1 million each. The $5 million one-on-one meetings have become a ‚Äúhot ticket‚Äù in the business community, says a source familiar with them. It‚Äôs unclear where the money is going and what it will be used for, but one source with direct knowledge of the dinners said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all going to the library,‚Äù as in the presidential library that will ostensibly be built once Trump leaves office. MAGA Inc  spent over  $450 million to elect Trump in 2024, though Trump is not legally permitted to run for a third presidential term in 2028. So-called candlelight dinners offering access to the president are known to have been held prior to Trump‚Äôs inauguration, but have not previously been reported to have occurred while he is in office. (Trump did, however, appear at a  number  of other  fundraising  events during his first term.) Most recently,  The Washington Post  reported that such candlelight dinners were held on December 19 and January 19‚Äîthe night before Trump‚Äôs presidential inauguration‚Äîfor the cost of $1 million per attendee.  Ivanka Trump  and Jared Kushner attended the January 19 event. In the lead-up to Trump‚Äôs 2016 inauguration, donors who spent seven figures could secure eight tickets to a candlelight dinner, according to a Washington Post  report  at the time. While previous second-term presidents have held fundraisers for their parties, the nature, timing, location, and price tag of Trump‚Äôs dinner all raise flags for experts. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúThe concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence ‚Ä¶ People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.‚Äù ‚ÄúPart of what is worrying,‚Äù Moynihan adds, ‚Äúis the lack of ethical guardrails in the current Trump administration, where there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a clear line between Trump‚Äôs businesses and the presidency.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/people-paying-millions-donald-trump-mar-a-lago/"},

The GSA‚Äôs effort to sell hundreds of US government properties is part of a blunt reshaping of the federal government and its workforce led by Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Staffed in part by  young engineers   with no prior   experience   in government , DOGE‚Äôs efforts have resulted in  mass reductions in force , the effective  shuttering of entirely independent agencies , and a  flurry of lawsuits  that seek to mitigate DOGE‚Äôs razing of the government over the past six weeks. The GSA published the list on Tuesday and pulled it down the next day. Before the full list of 443 properties was removed, more than 120 properties had already been quietly scrubbed, including 14 buildings that did not appear to be listed in the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties, a comprehensive public database of GSA holdings. Most of these properties, aside from one identified only as ‚ÄúBuilding A, 6810,‚Äù were labeled as either ‚ÄúButler‚Äù or ‚ÄúFranconia.‚Äù According to public records, all of them are part of a large federal facility known as the Parr-Franconia Warehouse Complex, or the GSA Warehouse, which sits, fenced in by chain-link topped with barbed wire, at 6810 Loisdale Road in Springfield. Most of the buildings in the complex, which dates back to the early 1950s and is dominated by a 1,005,602-square-foot warehouse long used as a government supply depot, are believed to be used by various government agencies for mundane purposes. Right in the middle of the complex, though, next to the warehouse and catty-corner to what‚Äôs listed as Transportation Security Administration headquarters, is a U-shaped building long notorious for its alleged ties to the CIA. ‚ÄúObviously, someone did no research about the long and well-documented history of this property,‚Äù says Jeff McKay, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and a longtime advocate of redeveloping the complex, which is near a Metro station and sits in a prosperous area. ‚ÄúNormally a site like this wouldn‚Äôt be outed, so to speak, but everyone knows it‚Äôs here except, apparently, the people who put this list together.‚Äù The CIA‚Äôs use of the building located at 6801 Springfield Center Drive, not all of which can necessarily be observed from street level, was  first reported  in 2012 by the Washington Business Journal, which in an article around the same time  called  the CIA‚Äôs presence in the area ‚Äúperhaps the worst-kept secret in Springfield.‚Äù The most specific description of its purpose, as the publication noted, can be found in the 2011 spy-agency-focused nonfiction book  Fallout: The True Story of the CIA‚Äôs Secret War on Nuclear Trafficking , by Catherine Collins and Douglas Frantz, who  write , while describing a clandestine operation: ‚ÄúThere were two pick-and-lock specialists from the agency‚Äôs secret facility in Springfield, Virginia. In a warehouse-like building there, the CIA trains a cadre of technical officers to bug offices, break into houses, and penetrate computer systems.‚Äù (Whether it is currently used for these purposes is unknown.) According to the Journal‚Äôs reporting, Fairfax County leaders like McKay were frustrated, because plans to redevelop the complex ran up against the existence of this facility. ‚ÄúThe entire challenge with redevelopment has been this entity,‚Äù McKay tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThis idea that you can sell everything around it and it will be OK runs counter to all the intelligence information we‚Äôve been given over the past couple of decades. Without divulging the specific details of the activities, the government has been very clear about the sensitivity of the property.‚Äù Even a widely supported plan to  relocate FBI headquarters  to Springfield foundered due in part to the CIA presence. While the FBI would not have raised security concerns, its relocation to the site would have raised logistical ones. Some government agencies, says McKay, said redevelopment was impossible; others said the secret facility would have to be relocated at the expense of the incoming tenant, making it far more expensive than other potential sites.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at dmehro.89, leahfeiger.86, timmarchman.01, and couts.01. Since Tuesday, GSA sources have been wondering about the possible inclusion of CIA buildings on the list that was posted and then deleted. One source with knowledge of CIA operations, when asked about concerns that the GSA may have listed at least one of the agency‚Äôs facilities as being for sale, immediately acknowledged ‚Äúthe Springfield building.‚Äù (The building itself, which in past reporting has been described as being held by a private owner, does not appear to have been listed for sale, but due to its sensitivity, selling the buildings around it would raise much the same concerns.) ‚ÄúThere have been rumors swirling that some of the buildings identified house classified CIA space,‚Äù says one source at GSA, adding, ‚Äúthe release of ‚Äònon-core properties‚Äô was especially surprising, as this nebulous language has not been historically used‚Äù at the GSA. As the Washington Business Journal reported in 2012, a real estate appraisal in the late 1990s listed the CIA as one of the complex‚Äôs tenants, indicating its presence there extends back at least three decades. It is nonetheless possible that the GSA does not know, at least officially, that the CIA has operated within the Springfield warehouse complex, a source at the GSA tells WIRED. ‚ÄúIn general, we have agencies that perform many critical law enforcement and national security functions,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúWe are not always aware of what type of operations are being conducted within tenant spaces. We build out operations to their specs and ensure their spaces are up to code. In my own personal experience, there are spaces in our buildings that not everyone knows about. Not necessarily CIA specifically.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it just shows you how completely unorganized this bird-shot of a list is,‚Äù says McKay. The CIA declined to comment. The GSA did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. On Wednesday, the GSA issued a statement acknowledging the feedback the agency had received and asserting that inclusion on the originally published list did not mean a building would be up for sale immediately. ‚ÄúWe anticipate the list will be republished in the near future after we evaluate this initial input,‚Äù the statement read, ‚Äúand determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not saying it‚Äôs CIA or not,‚Äù a former intelligence analyst who worked at Langley for more than a decade tells WIRED. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs reckless that this information is out there at all.

While backing down from some of her more extreme anti-surveillance views in the run-up to her confirmation, Gabbard nevertheless held fast to a few promises of reform that have been traditionally eschewed by federal law enforcement leaders. Now, some of the nation‚Äôs premier civil liberties organizations have begun lobbying America‚Äôs ‚Äútop spy‚Äù to follow through on a pledge to bring about new levels of oversight and transparency to a key US surveillance program that‚Äôs long been  plagued by reports of misuse . Led by the American Civil Liberties Union, at least 20 major privacy groups this week urged Gabbard to declassify information concerning Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)‚Äîthe nation‚Äôs cornerstone wiretap authority that, while aimed at collecting intelligence on foreigners overseas, is known to vacuum up large quantities of calls, texts, and emails belonging to Americans. In a letter first obtained by WIRED, the groups privately urged Gabbard this week to declassify information regarding the types of US businesses that  can now be secretly compelled to install wiretaps  on the US National Security Agency‚Äôs (NSA) behalf. While it‚Äôs no secret that the government routinely compels phone and email service providers like AT&T and Google into conducting wiretaps, Congress passed a new provision last year  expanding  the range of businesses that can receive such orders. Legal experts had warned in advance that the provision was far too ambiguous and likely to vastly increase the number of Americans whose communications are wiretapped. But their warnings were not heeded. It is widely assumed that the classified purpose behind the expanded authority is allowing the government to obtain access to communications  in US data centers . Lawyers for the US Justice Department attempted to unilaterally expand the reach of the program in 2022, but its efforts were foiled by the secret surveillance court that oversees FISA. Only Congress has the power to expand FISA, the department was told. As its a matter of secret law, lawmakers were unable to specify much about the limits of the government‚Äôs access in the provision they ultimately passed. This inevitably led to the adoption of a vague new definition for what the government calls an ‚Äúelectronic communications service provider‚Äù (ECSP)‚Äîthe term for companies whose cooperation can be compelled under FISA. Privacy experts and industry leaders had likewise raised concerns about introducing ambiguity into a law that defines the scope of a powerful surveillance tool, warning the changes could expose a  near limitless range of new businesses  to secret government demands. As WIRED  reported last spring , opponents of the provision in Washington had cast the surveillance program‚Äôs new parameters as effectively ‚ÄúStasi-like‚Äù‚Äîa reference to the defunct East German secret police agency notorious for infiltrating industry and forcing private citizens to spy on one another. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a renowned privacy hawk who has served on the Senate intelligence committee since just after 9/11,  has referred  to the new provision as ‚Äúone of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history.‚Äù Declassifying the new types of businesses that can actually be considered an ECSP is an essential step in bringing about clarity to an otherwise nebulous change in federal surveillance practices, according to the ACLU and the other organizations joined in its effort. ‚ÄúWithout such basic transparency, the law will likely continue to permit sweeping NSA surveillance on domestic soil that threatens the civil liberties of all Americans,‚Äù the groups wrote in their letter to Gabbard this week. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In addition to urging Gabbard to declassify details about the reach of the 702 program, the ACLU and others are currently pressing Gabbard to publish information to quantify just how many Americans have been ‚Äúincidentally‚Äù wiretapped by their own government. Intelligence officials have long claimed that doing so would be ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù as any analysis of the wiretaps would involve the government accessing them unjustifiably, effectively violating those Americans‚Äô rights. The privacy groups, however, point to research published in 2022 out of Princeton University, which details a methodology that could effectively solve that issue. ‚ÄúThe intelligence community‚Äôs refusal to produce the requested estimate undermines trust and weakens the legitimacy of Section 702,‚Äù the groups say. Gabbard is  widely   reported  to have softened her stance against government spying while working to secure her new position as director of the nation‚Äôs intelligence apparatus. During the 116th Congress, for instance, Gabbard  introduced legislation  that sought to completely dismantle the Section 702 program, which is considered the ‚Äúcrown jewel‚Äù of US intelligence collection and crucial to keeping tabs on foreign threats abroad, including terrorist organizations and cybersecurity threats‚Äîexhibiting a stance far more extreme than those traditionally held by lawmakers and civil society organizations who‚Äôve long campaigned for surveillance reform. While begging off from this position in January, Gabbard‚Äôs newly espoused views have, in fact, brought her more closely in line with mainstream reformers. In response to questions from the US Senate ahead of her confirmation, for example, Gabbard backed the idea of requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain warrants before accessing the communications of Americans swept up by the 702 program. Slews of national security hawks from former House speaker Nancy Pelosi to former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Turner have long opposed this warrant requirement, as traditionally have all directors of the FBI. ‚ÄúThis warrant requirement strengthens the [intelligence community] by ensuring queries are targeted and justified,\" Gabbard wrote in response to Senate questions in late January. The Section 702 program was reauthorized last spring, but only for an additional two years. Early discussions about reauthorizing the program once more are expected to kick off again as early as this summer. Sean Vitka, executive director of Demand Progress, one of the organizations involved in the lobbying effort, notes that Gabbard has a long history of supporting civil liberties, and refers to her recent statements about secret surveillance programs ‚Äúencouraging.‚Äù ‚ÄúCongress needs to know, and the public deserves to know, what Section 702 is being used for,‚Äù Vitka says, ‚Äúand how many Americans are swept up in that surveillance.‚Äù ‚ÄúSection 702 has been repeatedly used to conduct warrantless surveillance on Americans, including journalists, activists, and even members of Congress,‚Äù adds Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel for the ACLU. ‚ÄúDeclassifying critical information, as well as providing long-overdue basic data about the number of US persons whose communications are collected under this surveillance are essential steps to increasing transparency as the next reauthorization debate approaches.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/tulsi-gabbard-declassify-details-of-secret-surveillance-program/"},

The culling of  the GSA‚Äôs  18F division, in particular, a specialized digital services agency tasked with  improving user experience with government services  and helping agencies build and buy a variety of technologies, has crippled programs that silently but effectively prepared Americans for weather disasters or streamlined annoying errands, like renewing a passport or filing taxes. Over the weekend, around 90 technologists at 18F were  fired  via a surprise email that went out shortly before 1 am ET on Saturday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that what‚Äôs been lost is much bigger than a handful of individual interrupted projects,‚Äù says one fired 18F worker, whom WIRED has granted anonymity, along with other sources mentioned in this story, to protect their privacy. ‚ÄúAn entire ecosystem of dedicated technologists optimizing for the public and supporting civil servants is being dismantled.‚Äù When the 18F team was disbanded, the group was in the middle of working on a number of projects for agencies across government, including the IRS, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. One of the most public-facing 18F-supported services is the IRS‚Äôs Direct File program, which allows taxpayers to file their taxes directly to the IRS for free. Direct File is a joint program with the IRS developed by 18F and USDS before the IRS team was able to take it over. This year, the service is available in 25 states. It will remain active, 18F employees tell WIRED, but the reduction in staff could make it harder to expand it to the remaining states. Within the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Consular Affairs, 18F workers were in the middle of building a new system that would more efficiently process passport applications. Due to the firings, the bureau ‚Äúis left with significantly reduced capacity and momentum‚Äù dedicated to this work, sources from 18F tell WIRED. Before the firings, 18F was in the middle of revamping Weather.gov, the website for the National Weather Service, making it more user-friendly and stabilizing its public API, which outside applications use to provide weather information. As of this week, all development on the new site has stopped, employees tell WIRED, and its API improvement could slow dramatically. Weather has been a conservative point of interest for a while now:  Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs presidential transition plan, proposes that an incoming Republican administration could commercialize weather forecasting, which has been the work of the National Weather Service for decades. Hundreds of workers for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  were also terminated last week ‚ÄîProject 2025 did call for the privatization of some functions of the NOAA. ‚Äú18F was the people‚Äôs tech shop,‚Äù one fired 18F worker tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a giant hole left by the closure of 18F. Requests from across the country for help far outpaced 18F‚Äôs capacity before the closure.‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Like 18F, the  United States Digital Service , which the Trump administration rebranded into DOGE, has seen waves of firings and resignations. On February 14, around 50 USDS staffers were terminated, primarily affecting project managers and designers. Last week, another 21 resigned,  writing in an open letter  obtained by WIRED that DOGE‚Äôs ‚Äúscorched earth approach is driving away the people who actually have the skills to fix the government‚Äôs problems.‚Äù Itir Cole, a USDS project lead with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), resigned from her position last week after a majority of her team was fired and locked out of their computers before they could pass along their responsibilities. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre destructive and toxic. I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with it or have entanglements because of a deferred resignation,‚Äù Cole says of DOGE. ‚ÄúThe job changed. I didn‚Äôt sign up to work for Elon. I signed up to work for the American people. And when that changed I decided to leave.‚Äù For more than a year, Cole helped manage the development of the CDC‚Äôs Disease Surveillance system, which aided in the tracking and prevention of dangerous pathogens and illnesses like Anthrax and Zika across the country. ‚ÄúIt puts vulnerable populations into even more vulnerable situations,‚Äù says Cole. ‚ÄúThe program is probably going to die. There aren't enough people to work on it. I know folks who are left over at the CDC are working very hard to find alternative plans.‚Äù Inside GSA‚Äôs Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which formerly housed 18F, the recent firings have spooked the remaining technologists. Some employees, sources tell WIRED, have been reassigned to more public-facing projects like Login.gov, where Americans sign in to access benefits like VA services, Social Security, and Cloud.gov, which offers cloud hosting services to other agencies. ‚ÄúThe big change in how people are thinking about things is, why did they interview everyone about their skills and shit if they are just lopping off entire appendages of TTS?‚Äù one current TTS worker says. In early February, young DOGE engineers, like Edward ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù Coristine,  met with TTS workers , demanding information on their work and sometimes asking to review code. In a Thursday town hall meeting, Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now at the helm of TTS, announced that the workforce reductions at the agency weren‚Äôt over. Shedd, says one TTS employee, ‚Äúsat there four inches from the screen reading the entire time from his prewritten script and looked/sounded like a hostage recording a proof-of-life video.‚Äù Over the next few weeks, Shedd said, GSA‚Äôs tech arm would shrink by 50 percent. Any projects not required by law would be shut down, and the agency would prioritize more public-facing services like Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and FedRAMP, which promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across government. The DOGE executive order has authorized the group to operate only through the beginning of July, so it‚Äôs unclear what will then happen to these projects and teams.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-major-government-tech-projects-efficiency/"},

Sources also tell WIRED that Musk has wanted a government shutdown‚Äîan aim that runs contrary to the White House‚Äôs stated desire to avoid one‚Äîin part because it would potentially make it easier to  eliminate the jobs  of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, essentially achieving a permanent shutdown. The sources, whom WIRED has granted anonymity, specifically asked to be described generically because information about Musk‚Äôs support for a shutdown is closely held. ‚ÄúA shutdown has been his preference,‚Äù says one Republican familiar with the situation, referring to Musk. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs boxed in there by the president. I think it would be really hard for him to get around that.‚Äù A second Republican who had heard about Musk‚Äôs desire for a government shutdown tells WIRED that the billionaire‚Äôs goal is for the continuing resolution‚Äîa spending bill to temporarily fund the government‚Äîto tank, if only to achieve a brief government shutdown. ‚ÄúYou know none of this is about saving money, right?‚Äù says a third Republican familiar with the behind-the-scenes push from Musk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about destroying a liberal power base.‚Äù Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The possible shutdown looms as Musk‚Äôs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  has slashed its way through the government, eliminating the positions of an estimated  tens of thousands of workers . If a government shutdown occurs, many federal agencies and programs would be essentially put on ice. Agencies like the FBI and others with law enforcement and security functions would largely continue to operate as normal‚Äîalbeit with some government workers not being paid until after the end of the shutdown‚Äîand critical functions like the issuance of Social Security checks would not be directly affected. Every department has a  shutdown plan , though, and most would be impacted. Ahead of a shutdown, federal employees are effectively classified into essential or nonessential work, with nonessential employees furloughed and not allowed to work until the shutdown ends. According to federal agency contingency plans  compiled  by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service in 2023, when a federal shutdown was narrowly averted, the pool of workers who would be subject to being furloughed then numbered about 850,000, with about 410,000 of those being outside the Department of Defense. Federal personnel costs, including military spending, amount to about $340 billion annually, so even laying off all of the third or so of federal workers considered nonessential could possibly save about $110 billion a year‚Äîa fraction of the $1 trillion in annual federal spending Musk has claimed he wants to eliminate. Musk has spoken about removing so-called nonessential workers‚Äîmany of whom perform critical tasks like inspecting food, processing applications for benefits programs, and collecting weather data‚Äîbefore. ‚ÄúIf the job is not essential, or they are not doing it well, they obviously shouldn‚Äôt be on the public payroll,‚Äù  Musk told reporters  in late February, according to The New Yorker. Got a Tip? Do you know anything about the possible government shutdown or Elon Musk's work with DOGE? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, Leak2Lahut.26, and Vittoria89.82. According to  The Hill , Senate Democrats‚Äîeight of whose votes would be needed to ultimately pass the continuing resolution‚Äîare concerned that a government shutdown could impact federal workers on furlough. Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, said that he is concerned about Musk and the timing of the shutdown. ‚ÄúMaybe they decide that entire government agencies don‚Äôt need to exist anymore,‚Äù Kelly said on Monday. Democrats, save for a couple of  potential yes votes  from House members in districts Trump carried heavily, have been in a bind over supporting a bill that would keep the government open without addressing Musk‚Äôs work with DOGE. ‚ÄúIt is not something we could ever support,‚Äù House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York  said of the continuing resolution  on Monday, noting ‚ÄúDemocrats will not be complicit.‚Äù Many federal employees are also worried that a temporary shutdown could lead to permanent cuts. ‚ÄúThere are concerns anyone deemed nonessential will be DOGE‚Äôd,‚Äù a State Department employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, tells WIRED. The length of a possible government shutdown could also impact the dynamics, says Nick Bednar, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. A 30-day shutdown is a method of temporarily removing federal employees, he says. Many agencies have already been required to submit reduction in force (RIF) plans by March 13, but a shutdown plan is likely to be even more austere, allowing for only employees deemed essential to keep working. Guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) says that essential workers are those whose roles involve the ‚Äúsafety of human life or the protection of property or the performance of certain other types of ‚Äòexcepted work activities.‚Äô‚Äù Bednar says that under OPM guidance, there are different ways in which agencies can reduce their manpower: an emergency furlough like a shutdown, a planned long-term furlough lasting more than 30 days, and layoffs. Both planned long-term furloughs and layoffs trigger RIF procedures. OPM guidance suggests that RIF procedures would not apply to an emergency one that crosses the 30-day threshold. How an agency decides who to furlough during an extended shutdown is still up for debate, says Bednar. In the event of an emergency furlough, Bednar says, \"The agency must apply the furlough uniformly and consistently.\" Even though the agency is not required to follow the RIF procedures in the event of an emergency furlough, an independent civil service oversight board considers those rules when determining whether the agency has adopted a furlough fairly. Bednar says, \"We are in uncharted territory. There is not a lot of case law discussing how agencies should apply emergency furloughs.‚Äù In a  February 11 executive order , the White House ordered agency heads to develop a plan for ‚Äúlarge-scale reductions in force‚Äù that would prioritize ‚Äúall components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.‚Äù The order provided a carve-out for ‚Äúfunctions related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.‚Äù ‚ÄúA shutdown is aligned with the goals of DOGE,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúIn the president's executive order, he told DOGE to focus on nonessential employees, which is to say employees who are designated as nonessential during government shutdowns.‚Äù Only one partial government shutdown, in the winter of 2018‚Äì19, has lasted more than 30 days. A report from the  Congressional Budget Office later estimated  that the 35-day shutdown ‚Äúdelayed $18 billion in federal spending and suspended some federal services, thus lowering the projected level of real GDP in the first quarter of 2019 by $8 billion.‚Äù But for the most part, if a possible shutdown does last longer than 30 days, the US could enter into unknown territory. ‚ÄúOne difficulty in assessing what will happen is that there have only been 10 shutdowns that have resulted in furloughs in US history,‚Äù Bednar says. ‚ÄúMost of the case law we have on this issue comes from the 2013 shutdown, which was less than 30 days.‚Äù During the 2013 government shutdown, employees who tried to challenge their agencies‚Äô furloughs and sued for  back pay almost universally lost their cases . Bednar says, however, that if the Trump administration tries to use a government shutdown as an excuse to permanently eliminate jobs, employees might be able to appeal the decision. ‚ÄúI suspect the greatest impact of a long-term shutdown is that it will encourage federal employees to leave public service sooner rather than later,‚Äù says Bednar. ‚ÄúEven though federal law permits back pay, federal employees still need to pay for rent, groceries, and other essentials. The Trump administration could use an extended furlough to squeeze employees from their positions.‚Äù The White House believes that the lone holdout on the bill to avoid a shutdown will be Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who has firmly stated that he will not support the continuing resolution. Trump railed against Massie in a late-night post on Monday on Truth Social while trying to simultaneously praise the House Freedom Caucus‚Äîof which Massie is a member‚Äîfor holding the line. ‚ÄúThank you to the House Freedom Caucus for just delivering a big blow to the Radical Left Democrats and their desire to raise Taxes and SHUT OUR COUNTRY DOWN! They hate America and all it stands for,‚Äù Trump wrote, before calling for a primary challenge to Massie, who has  prevailed over similar calls  in the past. Later in the post, Trump wrote ‚ÄúDO I HAVE ANY TAKERS??? Anyway, thank you again to the House Freedom Caucus for your very important vote. We need to buy some time in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. Unite and Win!!!‚Äù If the continuing resolution passes, that would not take the issue off the table entirely, as it would only fund the government through September.

Vint, whose predecessor was fired by Trump in January, is one of a half dozen deputy inspectors general  urged by Democrats  on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month to investigate  reports from WIRED  and  other outlets  about DOGE‚Äôs efforts to gain access to a wide range of record systems that host some of the government‚Äôs most sensitive data, including personnel files on millions of government employees and their families. ‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned that unauthorized system access could be occurring across the federal government and could pose a major threat to the personal privacy of all Americans and to the national security of our nation,‚Äù Gerald Connolly, the oversight committee‚Äôs ranking Democrat, wrote in a letter on February 6. In addition to OPM, Democrats have pressed for similar security assessments at five other agencies, including at the Treasury Department, the General Services Administration, the Small Business Administration, the US Agency for International Development, and the Department of Education.

While in the minority in the House and Senate, Democrats have little power to conduct effective oversight outside of formal hearings, which must be convened by Republicans. During his first term, Trump‚Äôs Justice Department issued guidance notifying executive agencies that they had zero obligation to respond to questions from Democrats. Congressional Republicans have committed to little, if any, formal oversight of DOGE‚Äôs work, opting instead to  back-channel  with the billionaire over the impacts of his anti-personnel crusade. The executive order establishing DOGE, signed by the president on his first day in office, instructed federal agencies to provide Musk‚Äôs operatives with ‚Äúfull and prompt access‚Äù to all unclassified records systems in order to effectuate a government-wide purge of ‚Äúfraud, waste, and abuse.‚Äù It quickly became clear, however, that DOGE‚Äôs staff, many of them  young engineers  with direct ties to Musk‚Äôs own businesses, were paying little attention to key privacy safeguards; eschewing, for instance,  mandatory assessments  of new technologies installed on protected government networks. ‚ÄúSeveral of the concerns you expressed in your letter touch on issues that the OPM OIG evaluates as part of our annual reviews of OPM‚Äôs IT and financial systems, and we plan to incorporate those concerns into these existing projects,‚Äù writes Vint in the March 7 letter. ‚ÄúWe have also just begun an engagement to assess risks associated with new and modified information systems at OPM.

Inside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, vital support staff are gone, international partnerships have been strained, and workers are afraid to discuss  threats to democracy  that they‚Äôre now prohibited from countering. Employees are even more overworked than usual, and new assignments from the administration are interfering with important tasks. Meanwhile, CISA‚Äôs temporary leader is doing everything she can to appease President Donald Trump, infuriating employees who say she‚Äôs out of touch and refusing to protect them. ‚ÄúYou've got a lot of people who ‚Ä¶ are looking over their shoulder as opposed to looking at the enemy right now,‚Äù says one CISA employee. As the Trump administration‚Äôs war on the federal bureaucracy throws key agencies into chaos, CISA‚Äôs turmoil could have underappreciated consequences for national security and economic prospects. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has steadily built a reputation as a nonpartisan source of funding, guidance, and even direct defensive support for cities, businesses, and nonprofits reeling from cyberattacks. That mission is now under threat, according to interviews with seven CISA employees and another person familiar with the matter, all of whom requested anonymity to avoid reprisals. ‚ÄúOur enemies are not slowing their continuous assaults on our systems,‚Äù says Suzanne Spaulding, who led CISA‚Äôs predecessor during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúWe need all hands on deck and focused, not traumatized and distracted.‚Äù Talent Exodus CISA‚Äôs mission has grown significantly since its creation in 2018. Established mainly to defend government networks, the agency increasingly embraced new roles supporting private companies and state governments, advocating for secure software, and cooperating with foreign partners. This helped CISA raise its profile and gain credibility. But now, following several rounds of layoffs and new restrictions from the Trump administration, the agency is struggling to sustain its momentum. The extent of the cuts at CISA is still unclear‚Äîemployees are only learning about the loss of colleagues through word of mouth‚Äîbut multiple employees estimate that, between the layoffs and the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs deferred-resignation program, CISA has lost between 300 and 400 staffers‚Äîroughly 10 percent of  its 3,200-person workforce . Many of those people were hired through DHS‚Äôs Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS), a program designed to recruit experts by competing with private-sector salaries. As a result, they were classified as probationary employees for three years, making them vulnerable to layoffs. These layoffs at CISA also hit longtime government workers who had become probationary by transferring into CTMS roles. Key employees who have left include  Kelly Shaw ,  who oversaw  one of CISA‚Äôs marquee programs,  a voluntary threat-detection service  for critical infrastructure operators;  David Carroll , who led the Mission Engineering Division, the agency‚Äôs technological backbone; and Carroll‚Äôs technical director,  Duncan McCaskill . ‚ÄúWe've had a very large brain drain,‚Äù an employee says. The departures have strained a workforce that was already stretched thin. ‚ÄúWe were running into [a] critical skills shortage previously,‚Äù says a second employee. ‚ÄúMost people are and have been doing the work of two or more full-time [staffers].‚Äù The CISA team that helps critical infrastructure operators respond to hacks has been understaffed for years. The agency added support positions for that team after  a Government Accountability Office audit , but ‚Äúmost of those people got terminated,‚Äù a third employee says. CISA‚Äôs flagship programs have been mostly unscathed so far. That includes the  threat-hunting branch , which analyzes threats, searches government networks for intruders, and responds to breaches. But some of the laid-off staffers provided crucial ‚Äúbackend‚Äù support for threat hunters and other analysts. ‚ÄúThere's enhancements that could be made to the tools that they're using,‚Äù the first employee says. But with fewer people developing those improvements, ‚Äúwe're going to start having antiquated systems.‚Äù In a statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin says CISA remains ‚Äúcommitted to the safety and security of the nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure‚Äù and touted ‚Äúthe critical skills that CISA experts bring to the fight every day.‚Äù National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt says the reporting in this story is ‚Äúnonsense,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthere have been no widespread layoffs at CISA and its mission remains fully intact.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe continue to strengthen cybersecurity partnerships, advance AI and open-source security, and protect election integrity,‚Äù Hewitt says. ‚ÄúUnder President Trump‚Äôs leadership, our administration will make significant strides in enhancing national cybersecurity.‚Äù Partnership Problems CISA‚Äôs external partnerships‚Äîthe cornerstone of its effort to understand and counter evolving threats‚Äîhave been especially hard-hit. International travel has been frozen, two employees say, with trips‚Äîand even online communications with foreign partners‚Äîrequiring high-level approvals. That has hampered CISA‚Äôs collaboration with other cyber agencies, including those of ‚ÄúFive Eyes‚Äù allies Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, staffers say. CISA employees can‚Äôt even communicate with people at other federal agencies the way they used to. Previously routine conversations between CISA staffers and high-level officials elsewhere now need special permissions, slowing down important work. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt reach out to a CISO about an emergency situation without approval,‚Äù a fourth employee says. Meanwhile, companies have expressed fears about sharing information with CISA and even using the agency‚Äôs free attack-monitoring services due to DOGE‚Äôs  ransacking of agency computers , according to two employees. ‚ÄúThere is advanced concern about all of our services that collect sensitive data,‚Äù the third employee says. ‚ÄúPartners [are] asking questions about what DOGE can get access to and expressing concern that their sensitive information is in their hands.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe wrecking of preestablished relationships will be something that will have long-lasting effects,‚Äù the fourth employee says. CISA‚Äôs  Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative , a high-profile hub of government-industry cooperation, is also struggling. The JCDC currently works with more than 300 private companies to exchange threat information, draft defensive playbooks, discuss geopolitical challenges, and publish advisories. The unit wants to add hundreds more partners, but it has ‚Äúhad difficulty scaling this,‚Äù the first employee says, and recent layoffs have only made things worse. Contractors might be able to help, but the JCDC‚Äôs ‚Äúvendor support contracts run out in less than a year,‚Äù the employee says, and as processes across the government have been frozen or paused in recent weeks, CISA doesn‚Äôt know if it can pursue  new agreements . The JCDC doesn't have enough federal workers to pick up the slack, the fourth CISA employee says. With fewer staffers to manage its relationships, the JCDC confronts a perilous question: How should it focus its resources without jeopardizing important visibility into the threat landscape? Emphasizing ties with major companies might be more economical, but that would risk overlooking mid-sized firms whose technology is  quietly essential  to vital US industries. ‚ÄúCISA continuously evaluates how it works with partners,‚Äù McLaughlin says, ‚Äúand has taken decisive action to maximize impact while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and aligning with Administration priorities and our authorities.‚Äù Gutting Security Advocacy Other parts of CISA‚Äôs mission have also begun to atrophy. During the Biden administration,  CISA vowed  to help the tech industry understand and mitigate the risks of open-source software, which is often poorly maintained and  has repeatedly   been exploited  by hackers. But since Trump took office, CISA has lost the three technical luminaries who oversaw that work:  Jack Cable ,  Aeva Black , and  Tim Pepper . Open-source security remains a major challenge, but CISA‚Äôs efforts to address that challenge are now rudderless. The new administration has also frozen  CISA‚Äôs work on artificial intelligence . The agency had been researching ways to use AI for vulnerability detection and networking monitoring, as well as partnering with the private sector to study AI risks. ‚ÄúAbout 50 percent of [CISA‚Äôs] AI expert headcount has been let go,‚Äù says a person familiar with the matter, which is ‚Äúseverely limiting‚Äù CISA‚Äôs ability to help the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute test AI models before deployment. The administration also pushed out CISA‚Äôs chief AI officer,  Lisa Einstein , and closed down her office, the person familiar with the matter says. Einstein‚Äôs team oversaw CISA‚Äôs use of AI and worked with private companies and foreign governments on AI security. A large team of DHS and CISA AI staffers was set to accompany Vice President JD Vance to Paris in February for an AI summit, but those experts ‚Äúwere all pulled back‚Äù from attending, according to a person familiar with the matter. ‚ÄòNefarious‚Äô Retribution CISA staffers are still reeling from the agency‚Äôs  suspension of its election security program  and the layoffs of most people who worked on that mission. The election security initiative, through which CISA provided free services and guidance to state and local officials and worked with tech companies to track online misinformation, became a target of  right-wing conspiracy theories  in 2020, which  marked it for death  after Trump‚Äôs return to the White House. The program‚Äîon hold pending CISA‚Äôs review of a recently completed internal assessment‚Äîwas a tiny part of CISA‚Äôs budget and operations, but the campaign against it has alarmed agency employees. ‚ÄúThis is definitely in the freak-out zone,‚Äù says the first employee, who adds that CISA staffers across the political spectrum support the agency‚Äôs efforts to track online misinformation campaigns. ‚ÄúAll of us recognize that this is a common deception tactic of the enemy.‚Äù The election security purge rippled across the agency, because some of the laid-off staffers had moved from elections to other assignments or were simultaneously working on both missions.  Geoff Hale , who led the elections team between 2018 and 2024, was serving as the chief of partnerships at the JCDC when he was placed on administrative leave, setting off a scramble to replace him. The removal of Hale and his colleagues ‚Äúwas the start to a decline in morale‚Äù at CISA, according to the second employee. Now, staffers are afraid to discuss certain topics in public forums: ‚ÄúNo one's going to talk about election security right now,‚Äù the first employee says. ‚ÄúThe fact that there‚Äôs retribution from the president ‚Ä¶ is kind of frightening,‚Äù this employee adds. ‚ÄúA very nefarious place to be.‚Äù Abandoned and Demoralized The layoffs, operational changes, and other disruptions at CISA have severely depleted morale and undermined the agency‚Äôs effectiveness. ‚ÄúEven simple tasks feel hard to accomplish because you don't know if your teammates won't be here tomorrow,‚Äù says the fourth employee. The biggest source of stress and frustration is acting CISA director Bridget Bean, a  former Trump appointee  who, employees say, appears eager to please the president even if it means not defending her agency. Bean ‚Äújust takes whatever comes down and implements [it] without thought of how it will affect [CISA‚Äôs] mission,‚Äù the fifth employee says. Employees describe her as a poor leader and ineffective communicator who has zealously enacted Trump‚Äôs agenda. In town-hall meetings with employees, Bean has  said CISA must carefully review its its authorities  and urged staffers to  ‚Äúassume noble intent‚Äù  when dealing with Trump officials. While discussing Elon Musk‚Äôs mass-buyout program,  she allegedly said , ‚ÄúI like to say ‚ÄòFork in the Road‚Äô because it's kind of fun,.‚Äù according to the fourth employee. She was so eager to comply with Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat did you do last week?‚Äù email that she  instructed staffers to respond  to it before DHS had finalized its department-wide approach. DHS later told staff not to respond, and Bean  had to walk back  her directive. ‚ÄúBean feels like she's against the workforce just to please the current administration,‚Äù the second employee says. The fourth employee describes her as ‚Äúnot authentic, tone-deaf, spineless, [and] devoid of leadership.‚Äù McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, says CISA ‚Äúis not interested in ad hominem attacks against its leadership,‚Äù which she says ‚Äúhas doubled down on openness and transparency with the workforce.‚Äù The return-to-office mandate has also caused problems. With all employees on-site, there isn‚Äôt enough room in CISA‚Äôs offices for the contractors who support the agency‚Äôs staff. That has made it ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù to collaborate on projects and hold technical discussions, according to the first employee. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt much thought about [RTO‚Äôs] impact to operations,‚Äù says the fourth employee. According to a fifth employee, ‚Äúexecuting some of our sensitive operations is now harder.‚Äù (‚ÄúCISA has worked tirelessly to make the return to office as smooth as possible from space to technology,‚Äù McLaughlin says.) Employees are dealing with other stressors, too. They have no idea who‚Äôs reading their Musk-mandated performance reports, how they‚Äôre being evaluated, or whether AI is analyzing them for future layoffs. And there‚Äôs a lot of new paperwork. ‚ÄúThe amount of extra shit we have to do to comply with the ‚Äòefficiency measures‚Äô ‚Ä¶ [takes] a lot of time away from doing our job,‚Äù says the fifth employee. Bracing for More When Trump  signed the bill  creating CISA in November 2018, he said the agency‚Äôs workforce would be ‚Äúon the front lines of our cyber defense‚Äù and ‚Äúmake us, I think, much more effective.‚Äù Six and a half years later, many CISA employees see Trump as the biggest thing holding them back. ‚ÄúThis administration has declared psychological warfare on this workforce,‚Äù the fourth employee says. With CISA drawing up  plans for even larger cuts , staffers know the chaos is far from over. ‚ÄúA lot of people are scared,‚Äù says the first employee. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.‚Äù Entire wings of CISA‚Äîlike National Risk Management Center and the Stakeholder Engagement Division‚Äîcould be on the chopping block. Even in offices that survive, some of the government‚Äôs most talented cyber experts‚Äîpeople who chose public service over huge sums of money and craved the lifestyle of CISA‚Äôs now-eliminated remote-work environment‚Äîare starting to see their employment calculus differently. Some of them will likely leave for stabler jobs, further jeopardizing CISA‚Äôs mission. ‚ÄúWhat is the organization going to be capable of doing in the future?‚Äù the first employee asks. If Trump‚Äôs confrontational foreign-policy strategy escalates tensions with Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea, it‚Äôs likely those nations could step up their use of cyberattacks to exact revenge. In that environment, warns Nitin Natarajan, CISA‚Äôs deputy director during the Biden administration, weakening the agency could prove very dangerous. ‚ÄúCuts to CISA‚Äôs cyber mission,‚Äù Natarajan says, ‚Äúwill only negatively impact our ability to not only protect federal government networks, but those around the nation that Americans depend on every day.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/inside-cisa-under-trump/"},

In an email early Friday morning, CFPB staff were told that several people from  DOGE ‚Äîincluding Nikhil Rajpal and Gavin Kliger (along with Chris Young, who has been described as a Republican political adviser connected with Elon Musk)‚Äîentered the agency building Thursday evening. The email stated that they would require access to CFPB data, systems, and equipment, following a message sent Thursday by CFPB chief operating officer Adam Martinez confirming that the DOGE employees were to receive ‚Äú read-only ‚Äù access. ‚ÄúDOGE arrived tonight and will be back tomorrow. They are going to need read-only access to our HR (HR Connect/NFC), procurement (PRISM), and finance (Discoverer) system,‚Äù said Martinez. ‚ÄúI let them know that we utilize BFS/ARC so if they already have access, then they should be able to pull our data. Otherwise, if they do not have access to BFS/ARC, then we will need to work with them to fill out the necessary forms to gain access.‚Äù BFS/ARC is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service‚Äôs Administrative Resource Center, which provides administrative services, like timekeeping travel days or benefits, for a number of government agencies. The CFPB was authorized by the Dodd-Frank act in the aftermath of predatory and deceptive behaviors in the banking sector that led to the 2008 financial crisis. The independent agency has the directive to investigate and reform these financial institutions. The CFPB systems DOGE staffers will have access to contain information related to CFPB staff, like performance reviews, salary, and benefits information, a source tells WIRED. DOGE staff has also sought to gain access to procurement and financial data at other agencies. Over the past week, WIRED has reported that Musk‚Äôs DOGE team has gained access to a variety of government systems and infrastructure, including the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and  a sensitive payment system housed within the Treasury Department . ‚ÄúAll three will receive CFPB laptops and they will also have PIV cards so they are authorized to gain access as though they were a detailee assigned to us or one of our own employees.

Maye, who has become a celebrity in her own right in China over the past few years, had over 600,000 followers on RedNote when the flood of Americans arrived. ‚ÄúI need to find the block button,‚Äù one American user commented under Maye‚Äôs  latest video at the time , which has received over 10,000 likes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm witnessing American people confronting Musk‚Äôs mom to her face,‚Äù another comment in Chinese reads. Shortly afterward, Maye‚Äôs comment section on RedNote was closed for several weeks. New comments didn‚Äôt start showing up again until early February. The incident represented a rare moment when the parallel public images Maye Musk has created for herself collided. In China, the 76 year-old has built a largely apolitical reputation as a ‚Äú silver influencer ,‚Äù fashion model for local brands, and book author who regularly garners  positive coverage  in Chinese state media, The New York Times previously reported. Last week, she made another trip to China,  this time  to the city of Wuxi, where she was invited to watch a drone show, promoted traditional crafts, and posed with a special Tesla model that comes in  different colorways  sold only in Asia. But in the US, Maye‚Äôs career has increasingly converged with Elon‚Äôs as her son gained  unprecedented power  and influence over the US federal government. Since President Trump won reelection, Maye has traveled on Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-a-Lago dinner party, and attended a luncheon with Ivanka Trump, while also regularly firing off posts on X about US politics, according to a WIRED review of her social media presence. In many ways, Maye appears to be trying to straddle the fine line between her political engagement in the US and her business dealings in China and other foreign countries. That endeavor has become more fraught over the past two months as Trump began radically reshaping US foreign policy, including imposing new tariffs on China. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a heightened risk now for American business people traveling to China and that continues to increase, especially as tensions in the trade war will increase,‚Äù says Holden Triplett, cofounder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former senior FBI official posted in Beijing. Maye Musk‚Äôs business manager and Creative Artists Agency, her talent-representative agency in China, did not reply to requests for comment from WIRED. Even before she began traveling regularly to China, Maye publicly supported Elon‚Äôs and Tesla‚Äôs business endeavors in the country. In 2015, she retweeted a post by Elon in which he mentioned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. ‚ÄúGreat trip to China seeing President Xi ... Pic w China team in state garden,‚Äù the tweet reads, which was later deleted from Elon‚Äôs profile. Maye‚Äôs retweet, however, was still accessible at the time of publication. It‚Äôs a piece of largely overlooked evidence documenting Elon‚Äôs long business history in China and his relationship with the country‚Äôs government, which has attracted  scrutiny from lawmakers  as he took over the  social media platform X  and began playing a central role in US politics. While many top American officials consider China a key foreign adversary, Musk has rarely criticized the country and relies on it as a major consumer market and manufacturing hub for Tesla. Elon did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED about when or why he deleted the tweet as well as another seemingly from the same trip in which he said he was ‚Äúvery optimistic about Tesla‚Äôs long term future in China.‚Äù (Elon has deleted  hundreds of tweets  over the years spanning many topics, according to the PolitTweet archive.) Maye began building her own public image in China in late 2016 when she visited the country for the first time and spoke at an event hosted by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba. The company was promoting its global ecommerce fashion offerings and invited Maye, who it dubbed a ‚Äúfashion legend,‚Äù to appear on stage with Alibaba‚Äôs then-chief marketing officer Chris Tung. That same year, a biography of Elon Musk written by Ashlee Vance was translated into Chinese, and people in China were eager to learn more about the tech entrepreneur‚Äôs mother. But her career really kicked off in 2020 when her own biography,  A Woman Makes a Plan , was also translated into Chinese. Around the same time, she registered accounts on the Chinese social media platforms Douyin and Weibo and held a virtual book talk  with Wendi Murdoch , the Chinese-born ex-wife of conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch. She also expressed interest in visiting China and Tesla‚Äôs factory in Shanghai, but noted the pandemic lockdowns were keeping her away. Maye later modeled for Chinese brands looking to showcase their global appeal, including the Chinese smartphone giant OPPO and several fashion and beauty companies. In 2023, she went on a whirlwind book tour across China which included some events sponsored by a Chinese women‚Äôs underwear brand. By early 2024, Maye was so in demand that she was going ‚Äúto China nearly every month,‚Äù she said at a fashion show in February where she  walked the runway  for a Chinese designer. Her trips, in turn,  were celebrated  by China‚Äôs Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs as a way to encourage more foreigners to visit the country. While she usually emphasizes her career as a dietitian and book author, Maye‚Äôs China trips have also served as publicity events for Tesla. On that same 2023 tour, Maye visited Tesla‚Äôs Gigafactory in Shanghai and was featured in  a video posted by Tesla , where she praised the ‚Äúquality and the enthusiasm‚Äù she saw at the facility. (Last month, Tesla expanded its presence in Shanghai by opening a  $200 million  battery manufacturing plant in the city.) But Maye‚Äôs casual retweets and public support for Tesla‚Äôs global business turned into something much more dramatic this year. As her son was getting more involved in American politics and becoming Donald Trump‚Äôs largest donor, Maye‚Äôs social media presence in the West also experienced a 180-degree transformation. Her X timeline made almost no mention of either the word ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù or ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù until September of last year, but now she‚Äôs regularly endorsing Republican politicians and bashing the US media. In 2016, she tweeted about attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser with the hashtag #ImWithHer and a New Yorker story titled ‚ÄúThe Dangerous Acceptance of Donald Trump‚Äù but now appears in glitzy pictures taken at Trump rallies and Mar-a-Lago events. Her Chinese social media, which lists an email associated with Creative Artists Agency China as her business contact, doesn't show any of that. The focus remains brand advertisements, book promotions, and festive holiday videos in which she wishes happy Chinese New Year to her Chinese fans while wearing traditional Chinese clothes. She rarely brings up politics when she‚Äôs traveling in China either. Maye flew to China several days after the US presidential election in November, where she was asked during a panel event what she thought of the results and her son‚Äôs involvement. ‚ÄúHe is dedicated to making America a wonderful country and to give us hope. And now we have hope,‚Äù Maye said, before brushing off a question about whether Elon is expected to take a role in the government, saying only that he ‚Äúreally likes rockets and cars.‚Äù For now, Maye appears to be maintaining her relationships in China. On January 16, she was invited by China‚Äôs state-owned broadcaster to an event in New York City to celebrate the Chinese New Year during which the deputy head of China‚Äôs top propaganda department gave a speech. Maye was also interviewed and wore a white dress with a Chinese festive design that she said was ‚Äúmade specially for her.‚Äù Four days later, she would appear at Trump‚Äôs inauguration party in Washington, DC, with her daughter in a long red dress with a crystal-embroidered brooch in the shape of a chrysanthemum. She would spend several nights partying with people like Trump‚Äôs health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and artificial intelligence and crypto adviser David Sacks. Photos from these parties, just like those from the numerous American political events that she has been to since October, are nowhere to be found on her Chinese social media.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/maye-musk-china-influencer-brands/"},

A WIRED analysis shows that the account revealed the names of hundreds of Waltz‚Äôs personal and professional associates, including journalists, military officers, lobbyists, and others‚Äîinformation a foreign intelligence service or other actors could exploit for any number of ends, experts say. Among the accounts linked to ‚ÄúMichael Waltz‚Äù are ones that appear to belong to Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Walker Barrett, a  staffer  on the United States National Security Council. Both were fellow participants in a  now-infamous Signal group chat  called ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group.‚Äù The White House declined to comment after being presented with WIRED‚Äôs findings, but the accounts appearing to belong to Waltz and Wiles went fully private following WIRED‚Äôs inquiry. Earlier this week, The Atlantic  reported  that an account with the name ‚ÄúMichael Waltz‚Äù accidentally invited the publication‚Äôs editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat, in which senior administration officials discussed plans for a strike on Yemen. (Waltz  told  Fox News‚Äô Laura Ingraham he takes ‚Äúfull responsibility‚Äù for inviting Goldberg, adding, ‚ÄúWe have some of the best technology minds looking at how this happened.‚Äù) Over the encrypted messaging app, which Department of Defense guidelines  bar  from being used for the discussion of any nonpublic defense information, the group debated whether a strike should be carried out at all. Hours after an account with the name of defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared missile targets, strike timing, and other highly sensitive operational details of a coming strike, US forces bombed Houthi targets in Yemen, reportedly killing at least 53 people. A WIRED review of public data exposed on Venmo accounts associated with senior administration officials suggests that the Signal group chat was not an isolated mistake, but part of a broader pattern of what national security experts describe as reckless behavior by some of the most powerful people in the US government. The Venmo account under Waltz‚Äôs name includes a 328-person friend list. Among them are accounts sharing the names of people closely associated with Waltz, such as Barrett, formerly Waltz‚Äôs deputy chief of staff when Waltz was a member of the House of Representatives, and Micah Thomas Ketchel, former chief of staff to Waltz and currently a senior adviser to Waltz and President Donald Trump. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at  dmehro.89 or timmarchman.01. Other accounts carry the names of a wide range of media figures, from on-air personalities like Bret Baier and Brian Kilmeade of Fox News and Brianna Keilar and Kristen Holmes of CNN to a cable news producer, a prominent national security reporter, local news anchors, documentarians, and noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself the ‚Äúthe secretary of retribution‚Äù and once created a  deep state  target list. (Fox News declined to comment; CNN did not respond to a request for comment.) Many of the accounts appear to belong to local and national politicians and political operatives ranging from US representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas to a former mayor of Deltona, Florida, as well as venture capitalists, defense industry entrepreneurs, and executives like Christian Brose, the president of defense tech giant Anduril. (Crenshaw‚Äôs office and Anduril did not respond to requests for comment.) One of the most notable appears to belong to Wiles, one of Trump‚Äôs most trusted political advisers. That account‚Äôs 182-person friend list includes accounts sharing the names of influential figures like Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Hope Hicks, Trump‚Äôs former White House communications director. While none of the Venmo transactions for the account listed for Waltz, Wiles, or Barrett were publicly visible, it appears that none of them had opted out of sharing their contact list, allowing their friend lists to remain visible to the public. After WIRED reached out to the White House for comment, both Waltz and Wiles appeared to change their Venmo privacy settings to hide their friend lists. Venmo spokesperson Erin Mackey said in a statement, ‚ÄúWe take our customers‚Äô privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists‚Äîand we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.‚Äù The comment is nearly identical to the one Venmo provided to WIRED in response to a  2024 story about now-vice president JD Vance‚Äôs Venmo . Last July, WIRED reported that Vance had left his Venmo account public, exposing a network of connections to Project 2025 architects, DOJ officials, Yale Law classmates, and far-right media figures. (While it was not reported at the time, WIRED‚Äôs analysis of that public Venmo account‚Äîand the networks of his listed friends‚Äîfound that the Michael Waltz Venmo account appeared in Vance‚Äôs extended network, comprising friends and friends of friends.) According to The Atlantic, Vance was also an active participant in the Signal chat alongside Waltz, where he questioned whether the planned military operation in Yemen aligned with President Trump‚Äôs broader message on Europe. When the Michael Waltz account was set up in 2017, the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,  criticized  this design, arguing that it exposes users to unnecessary risks by making social connections public by default. It wasn‚Äôt until BuzzFeed News revealed in 2021 that then-president Joe Biden was easily found on the app that Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, added the option to hide friend lists. But that setting remains opt-in.  According to its privacy policy , unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. Mixed in with the high-profile names connected to the apparent Waltz Venmo account are a number of accounts appearing to belong to ordinary people, such as several doctors, real estate agents, and a tailor. These are the kinds of low-level connections that, experts say, spies look at for basic information‚Äîa relationship with a medical specialist could expose that a person is being treated for an illness that hasn‚Äôt been made public‚Äîas well as patterns, pressure points, or a way in. Experts call them ‚Äúsoft targets‚Äù: people who have access but aren‚Äôt protected. For instance, when the US and Israel reportedly sabotaged Iran‚Äôs nuclear program with the  Stuxnet virus,  they used a control engineer‚Äôs USB stick, not one belonging to a senior official. Chinese intelligence has used similar tactics, contacting thousands of foreign citizens  using LinkedIn  or  going after university  students to get closer to US researchers and companies. While WIRED has found no evidence that foreign adversaries have used Venmo to target a US politician‚Äôs network, the platform makes these relationships visible‚Äîpotentially giving adversaries a searchable map of the people around power. ‚ÄúThe first thing you think of is the counterintelligence issue, right? And the security vulnerabilities. It kind of boggles the mind, in a way,‚Äù says Michael Ard, a former intelligence analyst who now runs the masters program in intelligence analysis at Johns Hopkins. ‚ÄúIt would be really easy for somebody to spoof a contact, and that is something the security industry has already been issuing notices on.‚Äù Waltz has spent years inside the Republican national security establishment. A former Green Beret‚Äîsomething reflected in the number of apparent veteran Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and other special operators to whom the Venmo account bearing his name is connected‚Äîhe served as a defense adviser at the Pentagon under former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, and later counseled US vice president Dick Cheney on counterterrorism. In 2020, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Waltz says he was part of a small group of lawmakers privately briefed at the White House. Another participant in that thread was Hegseth. A public Venmo account under his name,  identified by The American Prospect  in February, revealed a similarly elite network‚Äîincluding names matching executives at defense firms like Palantir and Anduril as well as lobbyists and President George W. Bush‚Äìera officials. In the Signal chat, the defense secretary directly responded to Vance‚Äôs concerns: ‚ÄúVP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It‚Äôs PATHETIC.‚Äù Both Vance‚Äôs and Hegseth‚Äôs Venmo accounts have since been deleted.

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months. Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than  65 million people  in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits. ‚ÄúOf course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it‚Äôs also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,‚Äù an SSA technologist tells WIRED. The Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk  pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system  that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn‚Äôt actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone,  The Washington Post reported this week . This proposed migration isn‚Äôt the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The  agency predicted  that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects. Like many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration‚Äôs DEI purge of military acknowledgements.) As recently as 2016, SSA‚Äôs infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages,  the agency‚Äôs Office of the Inspector General found . In fact, SSA‚Äôs core programmatic systems and architecture haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúsubstantially‚Äù updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler,  according to SSA‚Äôs 2017 modernization plan . SSA‚Äôs core ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is also written largely in COBOL. This is the code that issues social security numbers, manages payments, and even calculates the total amount beneficiaries should receive for different services, a former senior SSA technologist who worked in the office of the chief information officer says. Even minor changes could result in cascading failures across programs. ‚ÄúIf you weren't worried about a whole bunch of people not getting benefits or getting the wrong benefits, or getting the wrong entitlements, or having to wait ages, then sure go ahead,‚Äù says Dan Hon, principal of Very Little Gravitas, a technology strategy consultancy that helps government modernize services, about completing such a migration in a short timeframe. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. It‚Äôs unclear when exactly the code migration would start. A recent document circulated amongst SSA staff laying out the agency‚Äôs priorities through May does not mention it, instead naming other priorities like terminating ‚Äúnon-essential contracts‚Äù and adopting artificial intelligence to ‚Äúaugment‚Äù administrative and technical writing. Earlier this month,  WIRED reported that at least 10 DOGE operatives  were currently working within SSA, including a number of young and inexperienced engineers like Luke Farritor and Ethan Shaotran. At the time, sources told WIRED that the DOGE operatives would focus on how people identify themselves to access their benefits online. Sources within SSA expect the project to begin in earnest once DOGE identifies and marks remaining beneficiaries as deceased and connecting disparate agency databases. In a Thursday morning court filing, an  affidavit  from SSA acting administrator Leland Dudek said that at least two DOGE operatives are currently working on a project formally called the ‚ÄúAre You Alive Project,‚Äù targeting what these operatives believe to be improper payments and fraud within the agency‚Äôs system by calling individual beneficiaries. The agency is currently battling for sweeping access to SSA‚Äôs systems in court to finish this work. (Again,  150-year-olds  are not collecting social security benefits. That specific age was likely a quirk of COBOL.

In order to migrate all COBOL code into a more modern language within a few months, DOGE would likely need to employ some form of generative artificial intelligence to help translate the millions of lines of code, sources tell WIRED. ‚ÄúDOGE thinks if they can say they got rid of all the COBOL in months, then their way is the right way, and we all just suck for not breaking shit,‚Äù says the SSA technologist. DOGE would also need to develop tests to ensure the new system‚Äôs outputs match the previous one. It would be difficult to resolve all of the possible edge cases over the course of several years, let alone months, adds the SSA technologist. ‚ÄúThis is an environment that is held together with bail wire and duct tape,‚Äù the former senior SSA technologist working in the office of the chief information officer tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThe leaders need to understand that they‚Äôre dealing with a house of cards or Jenga.

Experts say this is a potentially serious counterintelligence problem that could allow foreign intelligence services to gain insight into a target‚Äôs social network or even identify individuals who could be paid or coerced to act against them. The officials in question include Dan Katz, chief of staff at the US Treasury; Joe Kent, President Trump‚Äôs nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to the secretary of state. All three were participants in the  ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group‚Äù chat  in which  sensitive attack plans  were discussed and to which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited. Katz was named in it as a point of contact by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary; Kent by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to whom Kent serves as acting chief of staff; and Needham by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. A fourth official with an open Venmo account‚ÄîBrian McCormack, a senior staffer on the National Security Council‚Äîalso appears to have been in the chat, in which a user with the screen name ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù lists McCormack as a point of contact for the NSC. His account went private after WIRED reached out to the NSC for comment. (‚ÄúMr. McCormack has made necessary Venmo updates for his personal privacy protection,‚Äù says NSC spokesperson James Hewitt.) Morgan Ortagus, a former Fox News personality and deputy to Steve Witkoff‚ÄîDonald Trump‚Äôs special envoy for the Middle East, who was himself in the chat‚Äîalso appears to have left Venmo data exposed. WIRED established that the accounts are almost certainly those of the government officials in question by analyzing the other accounts they were connected to, which in the cases of Katz, Kent, and Needham included accounts appearing to belong to their spouses. The Treasury Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Some of the information revealed by the accounts is quite granular. McCormack and the accounts that appear to belong to Katz and Ortagus, for example, left not only their contact lists publicly visible but also their transactions, which are as recent as last autumn. These records reveal specific information like a 2018 payment from Katz with a note consisting solely of an eggplant emoji and how much he paid an overnight cat sitter in 2019. They also reveal McCormack‚Äôs contributions to what appears to be a get-together for veterans of the Bush-Cheney administration (‚ÄúCheney team reunion! Thank you!!‚Äù), who has reimbursed Ortagus for picnic expenses, and Kent‚Äôs connection to noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself ‚Äúthe secretary of retribution‚Äù and once created a  deep state  target list. WIRED has previously reported on the partially public Venmo accounts of several of the high-ranking officials in the Houthi PC chat, including  Vice President JD Vance ;  Mike Waltz , the national security adviser; and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Waltz and Wiles set their accounts to private only after WIRED reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday afternoon. Venmo did not immediately respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. In a statement given to WIRED in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, spokesperson Erin Mackey said, ‚ÄúWe take our customers‚Äô privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists‚Äîand we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.‚Äù Got a Tip?

If there‚Äôs someone out there looking to target you, they can use that information and start making you feel fearful for the safety of your children,‚Äù Lemieux says. ‚ÄúThe speed of the digital world has outpaced our ability to keep a handle on it,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúIf you have all this information out there‚Äîhow the heck are you going to put the toothpaste back in the tube?‚Äù Mike Yeagley, a specialist in commercial data and its security risks, has spent over 15 years advising the US Department of Defense on how both allies and adversaries leverage what he calls ‚Äúdigital exhaust,‚Äù the seemingly mundane details‚Äîsocial connections, service transactions, and metadata trails‚Äîleft behind in everyday apps. ‚ÄúAt the highest level of our national security leadership, regardless of administration, there has to be an awareness of our data and what we project that can be discoverable,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the risk of someone at the Cabinet level using Venmo to pay their personal trainer? On the surface, it doesn‚Äôt look like much,‚Äù Yeagley says. ‚ÄúBut now I know who that trainer is‚Äîor the gardener, or whoever‚Äîand suddenly I‚Äôve expanded my ability to target by identifying the people around that official.‚Äù Yeagley adds that ‚Äúour adversaries are sophisticated and carnivorous in their data collection,‚Äù which means that ‚Äújust the smallest bit of daylight is of interest to someone sophisticated. They will use that data point. They will build from it.‚Äù According to Venmo, its ‚Äúcontact syncing‚Äù feature allows users to upload phone contacts to the app so that they can find people they know. When these exposed Venmo accounts were set up‚Äîall before 2020‚Äîthe app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Venmo says this functionality was deprecated more than two years ago. Today, contact syncing no longer creates connections by default. To add someone as a friend, users have to search for them, send a request, and have it accepted. Nevertheless, according to Venmo‚Äôs privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. That means that even when a user sets their account to private, their friends list remains visible unless they take an additional step. As of publication, hiding your connections requires navigating to  Settings  >  Privacy  >  Friends List  and selecting  Private .

The effect was felt across the CDC, as workers in the  Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice  (DEHSP), the Division of Population Health, the Division of HIV Prevention, the Division of Reproductive Health, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control all received RIF notices today. Dozens of other programs throughout the CDC‚Äôs national centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; Environmental Health; Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and the Global Health center were also impacted. Multiple sources in the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that houses the CDC, say that RIF notices began going out around 5 am ET on Tuesday. Employees across HHS offices arrived at buildings only to discover that their badges no longer worked, sources tell WIRED. ‚ÄúI regret to inform you that you are being affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,‚Äù reads the email to affected employees. ‚ÄúThis RIF does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct. It is being taken solely for the reasons stated in the memorandum. After you receive this notice you will be placed on administrative leave and will no longer have building access beginning Tuesday, April 1, unless directed otherwise by your leadership.‚Äù The memorandum refers to the  February 11 executive order  from President Donald Trump titled ‚ÄúImplementing the President's ‚ÄòDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äô Workforce Optimization Initiative.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe cuts today at CDC targeted programs that address all aspects of American lives,‚Äù a source at the CDC tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThis will lead to worse health outcomes, greater risks to the US public, and will contribute to the decline in US life expectancy ‚Ä¶ programs that were eliminated fund positions across the country, in red and blue districts.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere has been no effort in allowing staff to transfer projects, programs, or responsibilities,‚Äù says one CDC staffer.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, makenakelly.32, and Kateknibbs.09. These cuts will have immediate impact, experts say. At the Division for HIV Prevention, where the stated mission is ‚Äúto promote health and quality of life by preventing HIV infection and reducing HIV-related illness and death in the United States,‚Äù at least half of the employees received RIF notices. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have patients die,‚Äù says Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago who also specializes in HIV prevention. ‚ÄúUnnecessary, preventable death.‚Äù Joseph Cherabie, a physician and assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, says that these cuts will have devastating consequences for HIV patients around the country, especially in rural areas: ‚ÄúIt will be catastrophic.‚Äù Cherabie says that states relying heavily on federal funding for public health initiatives, like Missouri, where he works, will be hit especially hard. ‚ÄúWe're still seeing young people coming in with new HIV diagnoses, sometimes advanced HIV,‚Äù says Cherabie. Along with six other states, Missouri has been  awarded  CDC funding dedicated to lowering HIV infections, which helps pay for medicine like pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) for at-risk patients. Cherabie says patients outside of cities heavily rely on these kinds of CDC-funded HIV programs. ‚ÄúOur efforts are largely dependent on these federal grants,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe use them to make sure that we are able to distribute HIV testing equipment. We use them to make sure that we can get information and data on how much PrEP is being distributed, how many HIV diagnoses we have, how many HIV tests we're giving out. If we lose that, then we're moving around in the dark.‚Äù An email from the CDC‚Äôs DEHSP center director states that the division is ‚Äúslated to be eliminated in its entirety.‚Äù The division includes the Asthma and Air Quality Branch, the Climate and Health Activity, the Emerging Environmental Hazards and Health Effects Branch, the Environmental Public Health Tracking Branch, the Lead Poisoning Prevention and Surveillance Branch, and the Water, Food, and Environmental Health Services Branch. All of these branches provide key services, and hundreds of employees received RIFs. Other divisions within DEHSP include, for example, the CDC‚Äôs Vessel Sanitation Program, which helps the cruise industry prevent public health issues, inspects cruises, and provides information on outbreaks. It‚Äôs unclear if the program‚Äôs work involving cruise inspections, or the  lists of outbreaks  on cruises, will continue. Similarly, the Lead Poisoning branch that works to eliminate childhood lead poisoning has also been gutted by RIFs. It‚Äôs unclear how much of its work will be able to continue. The CDC cuts are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to remove more than 10,000 Health and Human Services employees. Those sweeping reductions were ‚Äúorchestrated‚Äù by Brad Smith, a member of Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency,  according to Politico . The agency-wide cuts were originally expected to fall on Friday.  In a press release last Thursday , HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that this restructuring, paired with early retirements and deferred resignations, would reduce the agency workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. ‚ÄúOver time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,‚Äù Kennedy said in a statement  announcing the restructuring last week . ‚ÄúThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That‚Äôs the entire American public, because our goal is to Make America Healthy Again.‚Äù Anu Hazra, another infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago who also works as a physician at the nonprofit medical clinic Howard Brown Health, says that cuts to CDC funding will severely curb the type of HIV prevention and testing he does, and potentially outright eliminate some of the services offered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way that the work gets done,‚Äù he says; he does not believe that other institutions will be able to compensate for the loss of federal funding. ‚ÄúThe idea that you can just privatize public health, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a realistic solution.‚Äù Hazra says that funding cuts will disproportionately impact people like his patients on the South Side of Chicago, who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged Black communities that ‚Äúeither don‚Äôt have access or have really reduced access‚Äù to medical services including HIV prevention and treatment. Several doctors WIRED spoke to were unnerved because President Donald Trump‚Äôs first administration had championed federal HIV prevention funding initiatives, which aimed to essentially end new HIV infections in the US by 2030, so they did not anticipate this radical change. ‚ÄúThis work that we‚Äôre doing was thanks to him,‚Äù Hazra says. ‚ÄúThis is not just something that impacts people in the ivory tower. This is not just something that impacts people who are physicians, or scientists, or academics,‚Äù says Pagkas-Bather. ‚ÄúThis is coming for you.‚Äù Additional reporting by Emily Mullin.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-gutted-rif/"},

Now Democrats in the US Senate are calling to amend the half-century-old law, citing ongoing attempts by billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) to effectively commit the same offense‚Äîcollusively collect untold quantities of personal data, drawing upon dozens if not hundreds of government systems. On Monday, Democratic senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen introduced the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025‚Äîa direct response, the lawmakers say, to the  seizure by DOGE  of computer systems containing vast tranches of sensitive personal information‚Äîmoves that have notably coincided with the firings of hundreds of government officials charged with overseeing that data‚Äôs protection. ‚ÄúThe seizure of millions of Americans‚Äô sensitive information by Trump, Musk and other MAGA goons is plainly illegal,‚Äù Wyden tells WIRED, ‚Äúbut current remedies are too slow and need more teeth.‚Äù The passage of the Privacy Act came in the wake of the McCarthy era‚Äîone of the darkest periods in American history, marked by unceasing ideological warfare and a government run amok, obsessed with constructing vast record systems to house files on hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations. Secret dossiers on private citizens were the primary tool for suppressing free speech, assembly, and opinion, fueling decades‚Äô worth of sedition prosecutions, loyalty oaths, and deportation proceedings. Countless writers, artists, teachers, and attorneys saw their livelihoods destroyed, while civil servants were routinely rounded up and purged as part of the roving inquisitions. The first privacy law aimed at truly reining in the power of the administrative state, the Privacy Act was passed during the dawn of the microprocessor revolution, amid an emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks and ‚Äúautomated personal data systems.‚Äù The explosion in advancements coincided with  Cassandra-like fears  among ordinary Americans about a rise in unchecked government surveillance through the use of ‚Äúuniversal identifiers.‚Äù A wave of such controversies, including Watergate and COINTELPRO, had all but annihilated public trust in the government‚Äôs handling of personal data. ‚ÄúThe Privacy Act was part of our country‚Äôs response to the FBI abusing its access to revealing sensitive records on the American people,‚Äù says Wyden. ‚ÄúOur bill defends against new threats to Americans‚Äô privacy and the integrity of federal systems, and ensures individuals can go after the government when officials break the law, including quickly stopping their illegal actions with a court order.‚Äù The bill, first obtained by WIRED last week, would implement several textual changes aimed at strengthening the law‚Äîredefining, for instance, common terms such as ‚Äúrecord‚Äù and ‚Äúprocess‚Äù to more aptly comport with their usage in the 21st century. It further takes aim at certain exemptions and provisions under the Privacy Act that have faced decades‚Äô worth of criticism by leading privacy and civil liberties experts. While the Privacy Act generally forbids the disclosure of Americans‚Äô private records except to the ‚Äúindividual to whom the records pertain,‚Äù there are currently at least 10 exceptions that apply to this rule. Private records may be disclosed, for example, without consent in the interest of national defense, to determine an individual‚Äôs suitability for federal employment, or to ‚Äúprevent, control, or reduce crime.‚Äù But one exception has remained controversial from the very start. Known as ‚Äúroutine use,‚Äù it enables government agencies to disclose private records so long as the reason for doing so is ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù with the purpose behind their collection. The arbitrary ways in which the government applies the ‚Äúroutine use‚Äù exemption have been drawing criticism since at least 1977, when a  blue-ribbon commission  established by Congress reported that federal law enforcement agencies were creating ‚Äúbroad-worded routine uses,‚Äù while other agencies were engaged in ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù arrangements‚Äîcrafting their own novel ‚Äúroutine uses,‚Äù as long as other agencies joined in doing the same. Nearly a decade later, Congress‚Äô own group of assessors would find that ‚Äúroutine use‚Äù had become a ‚Äú catch-all exemption ‚Äù to the law. In an effort to stem the overuse of this exemption, the bill introduced by the Democratic senators includes a new stipulation that, combined with enhanced minimization requirements, would require any ‚Äúroutine use‚Äù of private data to be both ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù and ‚Äúreasonably necessary,‚Äù providing a hook for potential plaintiffs in lawsuits against government offenders down the road. Meanwhile, agencies would be required to make publicly known ‚Äúany purpose‚Äù for which a Privacy Act record might actually be employed. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030. Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the bill would also hand Americans the right to sue states and municipalities, while expanding the right of action to include violations that could reasonably lead to harms. ‚ÄúWatching the courts and how they‚Äôve handled the whole variety of suits filed under the Privacy Act, it's been frustrating to see them not take the data harms seriously or recognize the potential eventual harms that could come to be,‚Äù he says. Another major change, he adds, is that the bill expands who's actually covered under the Privacy Act from merely citizens and legal residents to virtually anyone physically inside the United States‚Äîaligning the law more firmly with current federal statutes limiting the reach of the government's most powerful surveillance tools. In another key provision, the bill further seeks to rein in the government‚Äôs use of so-called ‚Äú computer matching ,‚Äù a process whereby a person‚Äôs private records are cross-referenced across two agencies, helping the government draw new inferences it couldn‚Äôt by examining each record alone. This was a loophole that Congress previously acknowledged in 1988, the first time it amended the Privacy Act, requiring agencies to enter into written agreements before engaging in matching, and to calculate how matching might impact an individual‚Äôs rights. The changes imposed under the Democrats‚Äô new bill would merely extend these protections to different record systems held by a single agency. To wit, the Internal Revenue Service has one system that contains records on ‚Äúerroneous tax refunds,‚Äù while another holds data on the ‚Äúseizure and sale of real property.‚Äù These changes would ensure that the restrictions on matching still apply, even though both systems are controlled by the IRS. What‚Äôs more, while the restrictions on matching do not currently extend to ‚Äústatistical projects,‚Äù they would under the new text, if the project‚Äôs purpose might impact the individuals‚Äô ‚Äúrights, benefits, or privileges.‚Äù Or‚Äîin the case of federal employees‚Äîresult in any ‚Äúfinancial, personnel, or disciplinary action.‚Äù The Privacy Act currently imposes rather meager criminal fines (no more than $5,000) against government employees who knowingly disclose Americans‚Äô private records to anyone ineligible to receive them. The Democrats‚Äô bill introduces a fine of up to $250,000, as well as the possibility of imprisonment, for anyone who leaks records ‚Äúfor commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.‚Äù The bill has been endorsed by the  Electronic Privacy Information Center  and  Public Citizen , two civil liberties nonprofits that are both engaged in active litigation against DOGE. ‚ÄúOver 50 years ago, Congress passed the Privacy Act to protect the public against the exploitation and misuse of their personal information held by the government,‚Äù Markey says in a statement. ‚ÄúToday, with Elon Musk and the DOGE team recklessly seeking to access Americans‚Äô sensitive data, it‚Äôs time to bring this law into the digital age.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/democratic-senators-privacy-act-reform-doge-takeover/"},

Other sites, including HealthData.gov, Oversight.gov, and Vaccines.gov, have also periodically gone dark. It remains unclear whether these brief takedowns are linked to the recent executive order or if some are due to unrelated technical issues. However, some sites, like ProsperAfrica.gov, explicitly state: ‚ÄúIn order to be consistent with the President‚Äôs Executive Orders, this website is currently undergoing maintenance as we expeditiously and thoroughly review all of the content.\" WIRED built software to systematically check the status of 1,374 government domains. The tool runs periodic scans, tracking whether sites remain accessible, how their servers respond, and if the domain names still resolve.

Some of these outages can be attributed to routine maintenance or technical glitches. Others suggest broader infrastructure failures or deliberate removals. In total, more than 450 government domains WIRED is monitoring remain consistently offline. However, it‚Äôs unclear whether they were removed weeks, months, or even years ago. On January 26, President Donald Trump  signed an executive order  ‚Äúinitiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.‚Äù The result was a suspension of USAID‚Äôs work abroad, which includes  lifesaving humanitarian aid  as well as critical public health initiatives.

DOGE is based out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just steps from the White House. At an exclusive black-tie dinner hosted by the Alfalfa Club last week,  Musk  told associates that he‚Äôd even been invited to spend the night in the White House itself in the Lincoln Bedroom. The news shows how deeply Musk has embedded himself in President Donald Trump‚Äôs orbit‚Äîand how closely he‚Äôs following his tried-and-true playbook from Tesla and Twitter (now X). During busy periods at Tesla, Musk was known for sleeping on the factory floor. ‚ÄúIt was my primary residence,‚Äù he claimed during  an interview  with Ron Baron in 2022. He said the move was strategic, as he wanted employees to see him. ‚ÄúThis is important because if the team thinks their leader is off somewhere having a good time, drinking Mai Tais on a tropical island, which I definitely could have been doing ‚Ä¶ since the team could see me sleeping on the floor during shift change, they knew I was there, and that made a huge difference, they gave it their all.‚Äù The vision of a leader drinking cocktails on a tropical island resurfaced after Musk became Twitter‚Äôs biggest shareholder in the spring of 2022. In text messages to his friend, the podcaster and angel investor Jason Calacanis, Musk said Twitter‚Äôs newly appointed CEO Parag Agrawal was on a 10-day vacation in Hawaii. At the time, Musk had been toying with the idea of joining Twitter‚Äôs board of directors, but was growing increasingly frustrated with Agrawal. He doubted the two could work together. ‚ÄúBtw, Parag is still on a ten day vacation in Hawaii,‚Äù Musk told Calacanis. ‚ÄúNo reason to cut it short ‚Ä¶ in your first tour as ceo (!!!),‚Äù Calcanis responded, presumably with a hint of sarcasm. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt he be in a war room right now?!?‚Äù Musk then said: ‚ÄúDoes doing occasional zoom calls while drinking fruity cocktails at the Four Seasons count?‚Äù (The messages were  later revealed  as part of the discovery process in a lawsuit between Musk and Twitter). Ultimately, Musk decided he could not save Twitter with Agrawal at the helm, and he bought the company instead. After the acquisition was complete, Musk began sleeping at the Twitter offices in San Francisco. Employees saw him pacing the floor late at night and being escorted to the bathroom by his security guards. He even tried to get a bathroom installed next to his office so he wouldn‚Äôt have to trek across the floor during his stays. Musk‚Äôs lieutenant Steve Davis, CEO of the Boring Company, who has  reportedly been recruiting  staff to work at DOGE, also temporarily moved into Twitter HQ with his wife and newborn baby. Earlier this week, the US Office of Personnel Management, which is  already stacked  with Musk lackeys,  sent an email  to federal workers titled ‚Äúa fork in the road.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,‚Äù the email read. It directed employees to return to the office five days a week, and commit to a culture of excellence, or effectively resign and continue receiving benefits and pay through September. The memo closely echoed a note Musk sent to Twitter staff shortly after buying the company. In that note, sent November 16, 2022, Musk told staffers they‚Äôd need to commit to working long, intense hours to realize his new vision for the company‚Äîotherwise they should resign. ‚ÄúGoing forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThis will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-sleeping-doge-office/"},

Over the last few days, workers at the Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which is housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), have been summoned into what one source called ‚Äúsneak attack‚Äù meetings to discuss their code and projects with total strangers‚Äîsome quite young‚Äîwho lacked official government email addresses and have been reticent to identify themselves. TTS workers have also received confusing  transition guidance  and a sudden DC office visit from Musk. It was  announced last week  that Shedd, who previously worked as a software engineer for eight years at Tesla, Musk‚Äôs electric car company, would be the new TTS director. In emails to TTS staff, Shedd reinforced the  Trump  administration‚Äôs commitment to cutting costs and maximizing efficiency‚Äîsomething Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been charged with carrying out. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee at GSA or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters at  makena_kelly@wired.com  or  vittoria_elliott@wired.com . You can also contact them more securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 or velliott88.18. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent my entire career in Silicon Valley,‚Äù Shedd wrote in an introductory email to staff last Thursday and obtained by WIRED. ‚ÄúIf we work together and execute well we will be able to navigate the policies, leverage our technical expertise and be a critical part of accelerating technology adoption across agencies to enable great gains in efficiency.‚Äù TTS helps develop the platforms and tools that underpin many government services, including analytics tools and API plugins that agencies can use to deploy tech faster. This means that the group has access to troves of government data and systems across agencies. That access is useful for standardizing the many, not always interoperable, systems that the federal government uses, but could also provide invaluable information to a private company or be weaponized against government employees and citizens. Early Wednesday morning, rumors began to spread at TTS that employees would be receiving surprise one-on-one meeting notifications from management. During these brief meetings, employees would, according to a staff email that Shedd sent later on Tuesday, be asked to identify their biggest ‚Äúwins‚Äù and the most significant ‚Äúblockers‚Äù preventing them from working as efficiently as possible. The email linked to a Google Form questionnaire for employees to fill out ahead of their scheduled meetings. The invites included people without official GSA email accounts who were using Gmail addresses as well as official government accounts, multiple sources told WIRED. ‚ÄúThese should be items that you completed,‚Äù a screenshot of the form obtained by WIRED said. ‚ÄúIt is OK to have a mix of big projects and small wins (examples: fixed a critical bug, shipped XYZ feature, saved this amount on a renegotiated contract, ect [sic] ‚Ä¶ If you are an engineer or designer please include a link to a PR [pull request] or a screenshot of one of your wins from the past 3 months.‚Äù The email is reminiscent of one that Musk sent early in his Twitter days, demanding that employees email a one-page description of what they had accomplished the previous month and how it differed from their goals. Rather than convening with Shedd in these meetings, TTS employees were instead surprised to be met with people they had never seen or worked with before. ‚ÄúIt was a very confusing call because I expected to be meeting you, and I was instead met by two people reluctant to identify themselves,‚Äù one TTS employee told Shedd in an open Slack channel, one of several reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúThey had not seen the information I submitted in my form, so I was left trying to explain things without the visuals/links I had submitted,‚Äù one wrote. ‚ÄúAlso had the same exact experience,‚Äù another employee added. ‚ÄúThe individual I had met with had no idea about the google form I submitted and when I did reference it, I was met with avoidance.‚Äù In a Slack message to TTS staff on Thursday morning viewed by WIRED, Shedd apologized for the vague and sudden meeting invites, and for including unnamed individuals in the meetings who joined with Gmail addresses. ‚ÄúThey are each in the onboarding process of obtaining a GSA laptop and PIV card. I take full responsibility for the actions of each of them in the calls. I‚Äôve asked them to start the calls with their first name and confirming that they are an advisor to me,‚Äù Shedd said in a screenshot of the Slack message viewed by WIRED. Shedd told employees that the people on the calls were ‚Äúvetted by me, and invited into the call.‚Äù He said they were physically present with him at the GSA headquarters, and that he had ‚Äúbadged them all into the building.‚Äù This implies that those joining the calls did not currently have official government IDs issued to agency staff. At least two of these individuals appeared to be ‚Äúcollege students with disturbingly high A-suite clearance,‚Äù one TTS source told WIRED. (A-suite clearances tie employees to the GSA administrator‚Äôs office.) One person says they were brought into a review with Edward Coristine, a recent high school graduate who spent several months at  Neuralink , Musk‚Äôs brain-computer interface company, whom WIRED has previously identified as a person working at the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  and reporting directly to its new chief of staff, the former xAI employee Amanda Scales. He has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED, and OPM has declined to comment. ‚ÄúWe do not have any additional personnel announcements at this time.‚Äù a GSA spokesperson told WIRED on Thursday. It‚Äôs typical for TTS workers to work in tandem with other agencies across government, with many of their projects containing data external to GSA and subject to sensitivity agreements. Being required to share specific technical achievements, though, spooked some employees who feared they could breach these agreements. ‚ÄúThe team is correct in feeling nervous sharing details about other agencies in these calls and should continue to follow the normal guidance which is to not share sensitive information,‚Äù Shedd wrote in the GSA Slack on Thursday. ‚ÄúThe point of these calls is to talk through interesting example problems/wins and dig into how that win was realized. A chance for you to brag about how you solved a problem.‚Äù This week, it appears that TTS has become the primary target of these meetings, but members of the US Digital Services‚Äîwhich a Trump executive order has rebranded as Musk‚Äôs DOGE‚Äîalso met with management to go over their recent work last week. The DOGE meetings were conducted similarly in structure to the TTS ones,  according to The Washington Post . Like many other agencies, GSA has been making changes to DEI initiatives that have put workers on edge. On January 23, TTS deputy director Mukunda Penugonde announced that as part of the GSA‚Äôs new initiative to curtail DEIA programs, the agency would be shutting down its ‚ÄúDiversity Guild meeting series‚Äù and the ‚Äú#g-diversity Slack channel effective today,‚Äù in an email reviewed by WIRED. Musk was seen at the GSA office near the White House on Thursday, but it‚Äôs unclear what he was doing there. Shedd was scheduled to lead a meeting with around 40 TTS program supervisors Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday, WIRED reported that  Musk has been telling his friends  that he‚Äôs been sleeping at the DOGE office in DC. Of all parts of the government, TTS, perhaps even more so than DOGE, is well positioned to get inside agencies‚Äô technology and data, including government spending data, explaining why it‚Äôs such a focus for the new administration. ‚ÄúTTS represents the consolidation of 20-plus years of tech and data expertise, brought together by the hard work of hundreds (if not thousands) of civil servants,‚Äù Noah Kunin, a cofounder of 18F, a team of designers and engineers within the GSA that help government agencies build and deploy new tech products, and a former infrastructure director at GSA, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThey have the products, platforms, and people to do this work right, within the confines of current law, and fast.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-tech-workers-gsa-tts/"},

Their New HR Chief Dodged Them", "intro": "No intro", "date": "2025-02-01T19:03:31-05:00", "body": "On Friday, staff at what was formerly the  United States Digital Service  and is now part of  Elon Musk ‚Äôs DOGE initiative met with Stephanie Holmes, who identified herself as a part of the DOGE team and as the staff‚Äôs new HR representative. Throughout the meeting, which started at noon ET, dozens of USDS employees lobbed questions at Holmes related to last week‚Äôs  ‚ÄúFork in the Road‚Äù  email offering federal workers ‚Äúdeferred resignations,‚Äù according to documents detailing the meeting obtained by WIRED and corroborated by sources in attendance. The questions covered issues ranging from the future of staff projects to whether the return-to-office mandates would apply to fully remote workers, as well as the exact nature of the offer the federal government was making employees. Holmes‚Äîwho did not immediately respond to a request for comment‚Äîcould fully answer only a few of the questions. She said, when asked, that the offer was ‚Äúlawful,‚Äù and later said, ‚ÄúWe believe the offer is lawful,‚Äù and could provide little additional guidance beyond that. At one point, she was asked if there would be a more formal way to accept the buyout than replying to an email with the word ‚Äúresign‚Äù in the subject line. One employee expressed concerns that outside actors could send resignation emails on staffers‚Äô behalf by spoofing their email addresses. ‚ÄúI assume that, if folks do decide to go through with the deferred resignation, there‚Äôs some kind of actual agreement that we sign,‚Äù one employee said. ‚ÄúCan we get a copy of that ahead of time to preview? Can we get a copy of the agreement if there is an agreement?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Holmes replied. ‚ÄúBut will circle back on that.‚Äù The confusion comes as the February 6 deadline looms for federal workers to accept the deal. In the email‚Äîwhich was  very similar to one Musk sent Twitter employees in 2022 ‚Äîthe sender, identified as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), suggests that workers who choose not to resign could still lose their jobs later down the line. Holmes was asked if she could commit to a specific time to provide the DOGE workforce with additional details on the deferred resignation deals. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Holmes said. ‚ÄúYou know, I think the information that you‚Äôre going to have about this is available to you right now, and again, you‚Äôre just gonna have to make a personal decision based on the information that‚Äôs available to you right now.‚Äù The same employee responded, saying, ‚ÄúI apologize for the interjection, but there are a variety of things that this room has brought up that are contradictory or challenging to understand ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just wondering why you are unable to commit to providing those specifics right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I appreciate your question and I don‚Äôt mean to be repetitive or appear to be argumentative in any way, but again, I would just encourage you to not lose sight of the big picture here,‚Äù Holmes says. ‚ÄúThe benefits of accepting the deferred resignation is that you will be guaranteed not to be subject to reduction in force and you‚Äôre exempt from the return to office mandate. So I would just encourage you to focus on the generous aspects of the offer.‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you.

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump  signed an executive order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE, by reorganizing the US Digital Services, an existing entity housed within the Executive Office of the President, as the US DOGE Service. Trump appointed Elon Musk as the head of DOGE, which would take great lengths to cut spending across government agencies. As of publication,  DOGE faces at least three lawsuits  challenging its designation as a federal agency. While Musk has installed lieutenants at its top levels and is now using it as a lever to exercise control over the federal government, prior to the recent executive order, the US Digital Service was a relatively  small agency  with about 200 employees. Its mandate was to help untangle dysfunctional technology across the government, in service of which it had the ability to enter government agencies and access their software and technical systems. On Saturday,  404 Media first reported that Holmes , an employment attorney and consultant, was being brought in as the head of HR for DOGE. In her previous work, Holmes developed her own brand of ‚Äúnon-woke‚Äù and Christian DEI for clients to deploy. ‚ÄúWorking in the HR space and seeing the DEI efforts and progressive ideology that HR was pushing into corporate America was particularly concerning to me, and I didn‚Äôt see any other alternatives for employers in the HR space. I care a lot about these issues and saw a problem I wanted to help fix,‚Äù 404 Media reported Holmes said in a speech at a Federalist Society event. The resignation uncertainty extends to other government agencies as well; senior leaders at OPM were  reportedly told Friday  to prepare for cuts of up to 70 percent of the agency‚Äôs workforce and programs. On Friday evening, a senior OPM staffer sent an email to staff, obtained by WIRED, explaining that they did not have information on the details of potential cuts. ‚ÄúYou may have seen news reports that OPM leaders have been asked to prepare plans to significantly reduce future staffing at the agency,‚Äù the email read. ‚ÄúI do not have any definitive answers at this time about overall future staffing levels, potential change to our organizational structure, or the impact on specific positions. I understand that this uncertainty is very unsettling. Please know that when I have more information to share, I will.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hr-elon-musk-resignation-fork-road-leaked-staff-meeting/"},

The ‚Äútruth seekers‚Äù conference, held at a hotel owned and  frequented  by President Donald Trump, is being organized by Charlie Ward, an  antisemitic  conspiracy-theory peddler who lives in Spain and has a huge following online where he discusses QAnon, 9/11, the purported flatness of the earth, lizard people, and more. It will be a who‚Äôs who of US  anti-vaxxers  and  Covid deniers . The event will feature dozens of speakers, including many who led the effort to undermine the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, as well as QAnon promoters, election deniers like disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn (though his name was subsequently removed from the website promoting the event), and anti-immigrant campaigners like Christie Hutcherson, who  leads Women Fighting for America . The conference‚Äôs website also listed Trump‚Äôs daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as a headline speaker, though the event organizer told WIRED that her presence is still not fully confirmed. Hours after WIRED contacted the organizers, her name was removed. Andreas Kalcker, a German man who has promoted a bleach-like solution as a cure for autism and cancer, will also be in attendance. In an interview this month on Rumble, Kalcker said he would be presenting data and testimonials from users of his solution at the conference. Kalcker is  largely viewed as  the inventor of chlorine dioxide solution, also known as Water Purification Solution, Chlorine Dioxide Protocol, or MMS in other similar circles. (The letters stand for Miracle Mineral Supplement, Miracle Mineral Solution, and other similar variants.) Whatever name it goes by, it is a toxic liquid that has been peddled in alternative health circles for years as a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for everything from autism to cancer, HIV/AIDS, and Covid-19. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration  warned  that ‚Äúingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach.‚Äù Among the possible side effects listed are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and acute liver failure. Kalcker has focused much of his efforts on selling the solution in Latin America, and his promotion of the toxic solution is credited with helping  persuade the Bolivian government  to approve it as a cure for Covid. In 2021, Kalcker was charged by authorities in Argentina ‚Äúwith illegal practice of the medical profession and selling fake medicines,‚Äù  Business Insider reported , following the death of a 5-year-old boy whose parents gave him Kalcker‚Äôs solution with the belief that it would ward off Covid. It‚Äôs his presence at the conference that‚Äôs most concerning to activists who have spent years trying to highlight the  dangers posed by selling the toxic bleach-like solution . As the Trump administration pushes to  confirm anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy  to head up the Department of Health and Human Services, activists are deeply concerned that dangerous alternative health solutions, such as chlorine dioxide, could become mainstream by being associated with members of the Trump family. Fiona O‚ÄôLeary, an Ireland-based activist who has autistic children and has spent years trying to highlight the  dangers of toxic bleach solution being sold as an autism cure , worries that the Miami conference will ‚Äúplatform‚Äù Kalcker and allow him to increase his influence in the US. ‚ÄúAndreas Kalcker has been giving bleach to autistic children for many years,‚Äù O‚ÄôLeary, who has tracked Kalcker‚Äôs activities closely, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúKalcker is not a doctor. His protocol for autism involves poisoning autistic children with chlorine dioxide, bleach. Autistic children are forced to drink this poison all day long and forced to suffer burning bleach enemas. It is child abuse.‚Äù Kalcker did not respond to a request for comment. Tickets for the two-day conference, which is taking place following a charity golf event also organized by Ward, range from $50 tickets for basic access to $2,300 VIP guests that include accommodation at the hotel and access to the speakers. Ward, who claims to have been to Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago resort on a number of occasions, rose to prominence online in 2020 for spreading Covid-19 and QAnon conspiracy theories on YouTube before his account was banned. Now, Ward primarily livestreams on the alternative video platform Rumble, where he is a verified user and has over 200,000 subscribers. He is very well connected in Trump world: His previous guests on the show have included Flynn, former Trump adviser Roger Stone, and Trump‚Äôs current nominee for FBI director,  Kash Patel . Stuart Leary, the conference‚Äôs director, told WIRED that the majority of attendees are from the US, but up to one third of guests will travel from abroad to attend. Between 900 and 1,000 people will be attending the conference, Leary says. When asked if Eric Trump would be speaking alongside his wife, Lara Trump, Leary told WIRED he didn‚Äôt know. However in a conversation with O‚ÄôLeary, the activist, a recording of which was shared with WIRED, Leary says he has ‚Äúheard unofficially that two [members of the Trump family] will be there,‚Äù adding that they would not be making that public due to security concerns. Leigh Dundas, a California attorney who became a prominent pusher of Covid-19 conspiracies before attending the  January 6 attack on the Capitol , will be in attendance, as will Sherri Tenpenny, an anti-vaxxer who shot to fame when she  claimed the Covid vaccine makes you magnetic.  Tenpenny also claims vaccines cause autism. Scott McKay, known as the Patriot Streetfighter, is also slated to speak. He streams on Rumble and, in addition to promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, has inserted himself into  local school board debates about mask mandates . McKay has pushed  wildly antisemitic conspiracy theories  in the past, including claims that Jewish people orchestrated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as well as the assassinations of presidents Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and William McKinley. He routinely pushes the centuries-old claim that Jewish people torture children and drink their blood. In 2023, McKay was banned from speaking at another conspiracy-filled conference at Trump‚Äôs Doral resort after media reports revealed his antisemitic comments. That event was one of dozens of stops on the ReAwaken America tour, a traveling conspiracy circus organized by Flynn and filled with Christian nationalists, election deniers, conspiracy theorists, and numerous members of Trump‚Äôs own family. Ward was also banned from that event, due to his history of spewing antisemitic and Hitler-praising social media content.  Media watchdog Media Matters  outlined multiple occasions where Ward‚Äôs official Telegram channel, which was subsequently deleted, posted deeply antisemitic content, including a post that said ‚ÄúHitler was warning us‚Äù about Jewish people. When WIRED asked Ward about these posts, he denied making them, claiming initially that the channel referenced in the Media Matters article was a fake channel. When it was pointed out to Ward that an archived copy of his own website linked to that channel directly, and it had been promoted on his livestreams, Ward claimed that the account may have been hacked. He also claimed he had never posted anything on Telegram and that he had a team of people who did that for him. Ward did, however, admit to saying that more people were killed by the Covid vaccine than in the Holocaust. ‚ÄúHow many people in here know that more people have been killed by the jab than were killed in the Holocaust? And they're still doing it because nobody can stop them,‚Äù Ward said at a ReAwaken America tour stop. Ward told WIRED that 15 million people were killed by the Covid-19 vaccine, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs a fact.‚Äù This is not true. When asked for evidence to back up his claim, Ward could not provide it. It appears, however, that Ward‚Äôs antisemitic comments have not damaged his relationship with the Trump organization. ‚ÄúInterestingly, it was Trump Doral who approached us to come for our event this year,‚Äù claims Ward. ‚ÄúSo maybe they realize the truth.‚Äù The Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the event.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/antivaxers-covid-deniers-trump-national-doral-miami-resort/"},

Here Are All The Times He Did", "intro": "No intro", "date": "2025-01-31T13:38:13-05:00", "body": "One of the first questions  Kash Patel , President Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for FBI director, faced during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday was whether he was a ‚Äúfollower or promoter of  QAnon .‚Äù Patel‚Äôs response to committee chairman Senator Chuck Grassley was unequivocal: ‚ÄúI have publicly rejected outright QAnon baseless conspiracy theories or any other baseless conspiracy theories.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt true. Patel‚Äôs claim that he was not a promoter of QAnon is undermined by years of his very public and overt promotion of the QAnon community. Patel,  along with President Donald Trump , has been one of the main driving forces in keeping the QAnon community alive in the years since messages from the anonymous Q figure stopped being published on fringe message board 8chan. Patel has repeatedly praised the movement on social media platforms like  Truth Social , appeared on dozens of podcasts that promote the conspiracy theory, and created an entirely new trend within the movement. He even signed copies of his children‚Äôs book with a QAnon catchphrase‚Äîthough Patel subsequently claimed he used the phrase because of its connection with a movie. Patel has long been a figure of interest for the QAnon community. He was named in the so-called Q-drops posted to fringe message boards by the eponymous leader of the movement, who claimed to be a government insider seeking to help unmask a deep-state plot against Trump. ‚ÄúKashyap Patel - name to remember,‚Äù a Q-drop read back in 2018 when Patel was working as a senior committee aide to then House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes. In 2022, when Patel became a director at the Trump Media & Technology Group, Patel worked to entice the QAnon community to join Truth Social. ‚ÄúWe try to incorporate it into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences because whoever that person is has certainly captured a widespread breath of the MAGA and the America First movement,‚Äù said Patel on a June 2022 episode of the  Patriot Party News  show. ‚ÄúAnd so what I try to do is‚Äîwhat I try to do with anything, Q or otherwise, is you can‚Äôt ignore that group of people that has such a strong dominant following.‚Äù One of the key parts of that effort was the creation of a @Q account on Truth Social, which was  done by the site‚Äôs own developers . ‚ÄúHaving a beer with @q right now,‚Äù Patel wrote on Truth Social in February 2022, just days after the platform went live. The @Q account responded the following day, saying they were once again with Patel, and asking followers: ‚ÄúAlright anons, where are we kicking it tonight?‚Äù That post included the hashtag #FlannelFridays, which quickly took hold with the QAnon community after Patel promoted it, inspiring new memes and followers who dressed up in flannel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become this massive thing online,‚Äù Patel told  Russia disinformation promoter Tim Pool  during a podcast interview in 2022. In 2022, he  told pro-Trump influencer Mary Grace : ‚ÄúI agree with what a lot of that movement says.\" In recent years, Patel has even  published his own enemies list  of 60 people he claims are ‚Äúmembers of the deep state,‚Äù a central tenet of QAnon. Patel also regularly praised the QAnon movement for its ‚Äúresearch‚Äù skills. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen on Truth Social how good these researchers are, and I kind of wish I‚Äôd had some of them when I was doing Russiagate,‚Äù Patel said in another podcast with a conspiracy channel. ‚ÄúI talk with the president all the time, and we‚Äôre just blown away at the amount of acumen some of these people have.‚Äù When Patel released a series of children‚Äôs books in 2022, he posted to Truth Social an  image of himself signing copies of one of his books ,  The Plot Against the King,  with the explicitly QAnon-linked hashtag #WWG1WGA, which stands for ‚Äúwhere we go one, we go all.‚Äù The book features a besieged King Donald and a wise and loyal wizard named Kash, who helps his monarch. In the sequel,  The Plot Against the King: 2000 Mules,  Patel pushed election-denial conspiracies. Patel has not limited his promotion and endorsement of Q to Truth Social. Since January 2021, Patel has appeared on ‚Äúat least 53 episodes of 13 podcasts that have overtly promoted the QAnon movement and/or shared QAnon-related conspiracy theories,‚Äù according to an analysis conducted for WIRED by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public interest research. One of the podcasts Patel appeared on most regularly was the  Stew Peters Show , hosted by Peters, an  antisemitic   antivaxxer . When asked by Senator Dick Durbin during the hearing on Thursday if he was aware of Stew Peters, Patel said: ‚ÄúNot off the top of my head.‚Äù Durbin reminded Patel: ‚ÄúYou made eight separate appearances on his podcast.‚Äù Addressing the conversation on his show later on Thursday, Peters said: ‚ÄúClearly, Kash Patel is lying. He absolutely does know who I am.‚Äù Patel‚Äôs rapid rise within the US government and potential ascension to the role of FBI director was viewed among QAnon adherents as the moment they had all been waiting for, when the deep state would finally be unmasked, enemies rounded up and arrested, and public executions carried out. Rather than seeing Patel‚Äôs disavowal of QAnon as a betrayal, a review of posts on platforms like Truth Social, Telegram, Gab, 4chan, TikTok, and X show people on QAnon message boards defending his comments and praising his performance. ‚ÄúTHERE IS NO QANON, SO KASH TOLD THE TRUTH!!‚Äù one QAnon influencer posted on Telegram, referencing the false claim within the movement that the term QAnon is simply a construction of the mainstream media. ‚ÄúHe basically said they are not conspiracies but rather the truth, love it.‚Äù a follower responded.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/kash-patel-qanon/"},

Congress and agencies like the FBI have not provided the public with much information that confirms these allegations, but pursued a variety of different methods to ban TikTok. Responding to the decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew  released a video on the platform  thanking incoming president Donald Trump for supporting the app. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform,‚Äù Chew said. ‚ÄúOne who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspective connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\" Chew did not comment on whether TikTok would officially shut down on Sunday, but said ‚ÄúRest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come.‚Äù In 2020, former president Donald Trump first attempted to  ban TikTok  through a failed executive order. Ultimately, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill on April 24, 2024, requiring TikTok‚Äôs parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app to an American owner by January 19 or be removed from US app stores. In a rush to stave off the ban, TikTok and a group of creators quickly filed lawsuits against the Justice Department, arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates their First Amendment rights. In Friday‚Äôs oral arguments, TikTok‚Äôs lawyer Noel Francisco and Jeffrey Fisher, who represents the creators, attempted to drive home that argument. For the government, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the law did not violate the free speech rights of the defendants, and instead severed the app from ByteDance and Chinese influence. ‚ÄúWithout doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic,‚Äù Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion. ‚ÄúWhether this law will succeed in achieving its ends, I do not know. A determined foreign adversary may just seek to replace one lost surveillance application with another. As time passes and threats evolve, less dramatic and more effective solutions may emerge.‚Äù In its opinion, the court casts doubt on TikTok‚Äôs central argument that the law violated the company‚Äôs free speech rights, writing that the ‚Äúchallenged provisions are facially content neutral.‚Äù The justices wrote that the law does not appear to regulate the speech of TikTok or its creators, and instead targets the app and ByteDance‚Äôs corporate structure. ‚ÄúIt is not clear that the Act itself directly regulates protected expressive activity, or conduct with an expressive component,‚Äù the opinion reads. ‚ÄúAnd it directly regulates Bytedance Ltd. and TikTok only through the divestiture requirements.‚Äù The justices note that their decision should be seen as ‚Äúnarrowly focused‚Äù and applies strictly to TikTok. ‚ÄúTikTok‚Äôs scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government‚Äôs national security concerns,‚Äù the opinion reads. The law allows Biden to extend the January 19 deadline an additional 90 days so long as ByteDance is nearing a sale. As of Wednesday, the Biden administration  is reportedly searching for ways  to save the app, but it has not disclosed anything publicly. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED on Friday. A handful of US-based financiers have lined up to buy the app, including  former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt . Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, or ‚ÄúMr. Wonderful,‚Äù of  Shark Tank  fame,  has signed on to McCourt‚Äôs proposal  and recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. ‚ÄúWe have a formal offer on the table with ByteDance. We are ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal. Together, we can transition TikTok to a clean tech stack and turn this national security problem into a big win for Americans,‚Äù McCourt said in a statement responding to the decision on Friday. While rumors have spread that ByteDance could be pursuing  a sale with Elon Musk , TikTok and its owner have not confirmed any of these reports. On Thursday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer  joined a growing chorus  of US lawmakers, many of whom voted in favor of the ban, looking to give the company more time to find a suitable buyer. Despite being the first president to try banning TikTok, incoming president Donald Trump has suggested that he would try to broker a deal that could save the app once he returns to the White House. In an amicus brief filed last month, Trump asked the court to pause the law from going into effect to allow for him to  find a ‚Äúpolitical resolution‚Äù to save it . TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew  is reportedly attending  Trump‚Äôs inauguration on Monday. Trump said that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping over the phone  in a Friday morning Truth Social post . ‚ÄúIt is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,‚Äù Trump wrote in another Truth Social post on Friday. ‚ÄúMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!‚Äù ‚ÄúBy refusing to block this ban, the Supreme Court is giving the executive branch unprecedented power to silence speech it doesn‚Äôt like, increasing the danger that sweeping invocations of ‚Äònational security‚Äô will trump our constitutional rights,‚Äù Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU‚Äôs National Security Project said in a statement on Friday. Unless TikTok decides to shut down the app on its own, US users will likely be able to use it  for at least the near future . The law forbids mobile app stores from providing access to TikTok and would make it difficult for new users to download the app. TikTok will continue to work for users who already have the app on their phone, but they will no longer have access to updates, which could make TikTok glitchier and possibly unusable over time.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/"},

It‚Äôs a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\" It‚Äôs the latest salvo in the  dramatic fight  over TikTok‚Äôs future in the US. Last year, Congress passed a  law  that required ByteDance, TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent company, to divest its US operations or face a ban starting January 19. TikTok sued on First Amendment grounds but lost at the  Supreme Court . Last night, Apple and Google took the app out of their respective app stores, as well as many other apps developed by ByteDance. Oracle reportedly told employees to shut down servers that hosted TikTok US data, according to  The Information . The move set the stage for President-elect Trump, who‚Äôd tried to ban TikTok when he was in office, to save the app before he is sworn in as President. ‚ÄúI will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law‚Äôs prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,‚Äù  he wrote on Truth Social  Sunday morning. ‚ÄúThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.‚Äù Technically, the law only allows Trump to extend the enforcement deadline if ByteDance makes real progress  on a deal to divest its US operations . Among those whose names have been mentioned as possible acquirers: Elon Musk and fellow billionaire Frank McCourt. While McCourt made  an official bid , Musk‚Äôs name was  reportedly floated  in discussions with the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg. ‚ÄúI would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,‚Äù Trump wrote on Truth Social. ‚ÄúBy doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.‚Äù TikTok, in addition to other ByteDance-owned apps, is still not back in US app stores as of publication. But several users have reported being able to access their timelines again after they were listed as unavailable last night. Others had regained access to their accounts, but with varying degrees of functionality. After the Supreme Court decision, the Biden administration appeared to walk back its commitment to the ban, saying that it was  leaving enforcement  up to the Trump administration. That reassurance was not enough for TikTok, which voluntarily took itself offline ahead of the deadline. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appealed directly to Trump in a TikTok where he thanked the incoming president for his commitment to working with the company ‚Äúto find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.‚Äù On Blind, an anonymous messaging app that requires users to verify their employment before viewing company-specific posts, users mocked the video. ‚ÄúCEO begging Trump to save TT,‚Äù one wrote. ‚ÄúThis is so cringe,‚Äù another responded. While many in Washington appeared to quietly stop supporting the ban, which had  declined in popularity  among US adults in recent months, others applauded the decision and voiced outrage when TikTok announced it was coming back online. ‚ÄúAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs.

Some elections are important, some are not, but this one really mattered,‚Äù Musk said during his address inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, hours after  Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States . ‚ÄúAnd I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you.‚Äù At this point, Musk put his right hand on his chest before extending it straight out with his palm facing down and his fingers touching, a gesture widely recognized as the ‚ÄúRoman salute.‚Äù Adopted by the fascist movement a century ago, it was most famously used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, and is to this day associated with the fascist right, especially in Italy. After he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture. ‚ÄúMy heart goes out to you,‚Äù Musk added. Musk subsequently shared a clip of his speech on X, but at the point where he makes the first salute, the  clip posted by Musk  cuts away to a shot of the audience before returning to show him making the second salute. Musk, X, and the Trump administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but after this article was published Musk responded to the backlash in a post on X, writing: ‚ÄúFrankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‚Äòeveryone is Hitler‚Äô attack is sooo tired.‚Äù The response from the neo-Nazi community across the globe was instant and unanimous. ‚ÄúIncredible things are happening already,‚Äù Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a social media platform popular with antisemites and white supremacists, wrote over a picture of Musk giving the salute. ‚ÄúThe entire neo-Nazi movement seems to be eating it up,‚Äù says Nick Martin, an investigative journalist who closely tracks extremist groups and runs the online publication  The Informant . ‚ÄúHe gave two unmistakable Nazi salutes, and they got the message loud and clear.‚Äù ‚ÄúWE ARE FUCKING BACK,‚Äù the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute. Members of the group responded with the lightning bolt emoji,  a well-known neo-Nazi reference  to the SS. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if this was a mistake, I‚Äôm going to enjoy the tears over it,‚Äù Christopher Pohlhaus, the leader of the  American neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe , wrote on his Telegram channel under a gif of the Musk salute. Keith Woods, a prominent far-right influencer from Ireland who has repeatedly praised Musk, responded to the actions by writing on X: ‚ÄúOK maybe woke really is dead.‚Äù Evan Kilgore, a right-wing political commentator, wrote on X: ‚ÄúHoly crap ‚Ä¶ did Elon Musk just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington DC ‚Ä¶ This is incredible.‚Äù Kilgore later wrote: ‚ÄúWe are so back.‚Äù Kilgore, who  is a Holocaust denier , has worked as an ambassador for Charlie Kirk‚Äôs Turning Point USA.

They carried ring lights, posed with cardboard cutouts of  Elon Musk  wearing cowboy hats, and partied with Waka Flocka. The event was sponsored by  TikTok  and called the Power 30 awards, to celebrate the right‚Äôs online cultural takeover. It took place at the Sax, a club decked out with plush velvet walls and garish gold decor located only a few blocks away from the White House. In 2024, Trump and the Republicans won the election with TikTok collabs and podcast interviews. At this party and others across Washington, D,C on Sunday night, dozens of podcasters, influencers, and Republican digital strategists took their victory lap, boozing with their online mutuals and handing out awards for their accomplishments. ‚ÄúI wanted to recognize the people who paved the way for the president's return to the White House,‚Äù says CJ Pearson, cochair of the RNC‚Äôs youth advisory council and a host of Sunday‚Äôs event. ‚ÄúWe won the influencer election in 2024. We won one of the most important battles, one of the longest-standing culture wars of our time.‚Äù This party was for celebrating their victory‚Äîand preparing to continue their work under the incoming Trump administration. Creators and influencers were  all over the 2024 election . They were at  the Republican  and  Democratic conventions  and the presidential and vice presidential debates. They streamed from fundraisers and rallies, and appeared on every social media app. They took to the airwaves too‚Äîcontent creators turned podcasters spent countless hours promoting candidates. While  Democrats  spent years building out their cohort of influencers, hosting them at campaign events and even President Joe Biden‚Äôs White House, the GOP did it better. Despite the Trump campaign‚Äôs steep  fundraising  disadvantages, it partnered with popular podcasters like the comedian Theo Von and Joe Rogan. The interviews were cost-effective and reached massive audiences, in the millions, within hours of their publication. Trump collaborated with OG vloggers turned professional fighters  Jake  and Logan Paul, along with Kick streamer Adin Ross and other creators,  catering to the ‚Äúmanosphere.‚Äù  During the presidential debates, similar faces‚Äîand others‚Äîstowed away in conference rooms that turned into makeshift influencer ‚Äúwar rooms.‚Äù For years, conservative political influencers  picked fights  with platforms that would, they claimed, ‚Äúunjustly‚Äù ban or fact-check them. But recently, with  Elon Musk‚Äôs  control of X and  Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs  removal of fact-checking and many hate speech protections from Meta‚Äôs platforms, times have changed. These creators and influencers aren‚Äôt working on the fringes anymore, but have found a home right back on these platforms and in the mainstream. Throughout the inauguration weekend, Silicon Valley tech companies hosted a variety of creator-focused parties celebrating Trump‚Äôs White House takeover. Spotify held a special brunch for podcasters, including the  Daily Wire ‚Äôs Ben Shapiro. Google and YouTube are hosting their own reception for creators and podcasters, a source familiar told WIRED. At the Power 30 party sponsored by TikTok, conservative content creators leaned into their newfound patrons, dancing to top 40 hits for hours in Make America Great Again hats with TikTok-labeled ear muffs stretched over them. At another TikTok-sponsored party at the Capital One Arena Saturday night, conservative creators received company merch, like a koozie with a graphic of Trump dancing or ear muffs in the company‚Äôs highlighter pink and blue colors. (Behind the scenes,  TikTok  appeared to be in turmoil. The app had gone offline Saturday night ahead of the presumptive ban, but  returned Sunday  and pushed a notification assuring its users that Trump would save the app once he took office.) ‚ÄúOne of the best parts about my job is actually getting to spend time with our YouTube Creators, because they really do set the culture,‚Äù Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, said in a statement following the company‚Äôs Sunday creator event. ‚ÄúThey are experimenting with new ideas in the media landscape, and it was amazing to have a front row seat this past year.‚Äù At Sunday‚Äôs influencer awards party, Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz, an architect of this winning influencer and online-focused strategy, received an award honoring his digital contributions. Years before joining Trump‚Äôs team, Bruesewitz ran X Strategies, a political media agency, working with young, online political candidates like Matt Gaetz. In 2022, he published  Winning the Social Media War: How Conservatives Can Fight Back, Reclaim the Narrative, and Turn the Tides Against the Left , a book instructing Republicans on how to use social media for electoral gains. ‚ÄúSocial media has created an entirely new battlefront for us,‚Äù Bruesewitz wrote in 2022. ‚ÄúWe have to fight back, we will make them listen, and we will reopen the marketplace.‚Äù Bruesewitz saw the potential podcasts had to bring Trump‚Äôs message to voters who weren‚Äôt already hearing it. The podcasts played a major role in Trump‚Äôs election, providing him with massive audiences of what Bruesewitz described as ‚Äúmedium- and low-propensity male voters‚Äù  in an interview with WIRED after the election . It was these voters, who Bruesewitz said don‚Äôt usually consume mainstream media, that secured the win. Others agreed: Shapiro told WIRED on Sunday that podcasts ‚Äúgave a window into the authenticity of the candidates.‚Äù And according to Pearson, this year‚Äôs conservative influencer takeover is just the beginning. Over the summer, Pearson hosted an event with the Heritage Foundation to train more than two dozen conservative creators on how to communicate their politics with voters online. Savannah Chrisley, Sean Mike Kelly, and Emily Saves America, some of whom came out of the Turning Point USA ambassador program, attended the event. Since 2019, Turning Point has recruited and trained  at least 400 conservative influencers  in what is essentially an incubator. Some of the most popular influencers on the right have come out of Turning Point‚Äôs program, including Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, and Candace Owens. The training typically takes place at summits held around the country where Turning Point leadership, like Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer,  teach attendees how to post . Once an influencer is onboarded onto Turning Point‚Äôs influencer program, the organization‚Äôs public relations team  actively pitches them  to producers on networks like Fox News. They‚Äôre invited to special events where speakers (including Trump and Tucker Carlson) give speeches and allow for creators to network and collaborate to grow their audiences. ‚ÄúTPUSA has partnered with hundreds of dynamic personalities and content creators, from in-house contributors crafting content five days a week to influencers seamlessly integrating the message of freedom into their online presence and attending our premier events,‚Äù  the organization‚Äôs website says . ‚ÄúWe instituted our influencer program right after Trump got elected the first time,‚Äù Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, told WIRED on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe left has gotten lazy, depending on Hollywood for influence, while we've had homegrown influencers that come right here from Turning Point. The amount of reach we've received is in the billions, with people that people actually listen to while the left has relied on Hollywood.‚Äù GOP operatives are already planning new influencer training events to take place. ‚ÄúIn the coming months we‚Äôll be recruiting up-and-coming influencers, molding them, investing in them, and helping them grow their platforms,‚Äù says Pearson. ‚ÄúAnd this event also is a little bit of a kickoff to that, so we're super excited about it.‚Äù The  Biden White House  invited influencers to events and special briefings, but the incoming Trump administration seems eager to incorporate them into its everyday media apparatus. At Pete Hegseth‚Äôs confirmation hearing for defense secretary, there were at least two conservative creators in the room.  Graham Allen  and  Rob Smith , a pair of veterans and Turning Point USA influencers, sat in on the hearing, shooting video clips and writing tweets supporting Trump‚Äôs nominee and combating any criticism he received in real time online. When asked if the influencers were requested by the Trump team to attend and create content at Hegseth‚Äôs confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Trump adviser Jason Miller told WIRED, ‚ÄúHegseth has many friends, former military colleagues, Gold Star families, and more who back his nomination, dozens of which are here to support him today!‚Äù On Monday, a handful of the creators who bolstered Trump‚Äôs campaign online will attend the incoming president‚Äôs inaugural events. These moments will not only symbolize a new political era in the US, but a cultural one: one where people like Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, Von, and the Paul brothers have the ear of the president. \"We've won a really important battle in the culture war, but it's certainly not over. The war continues,‚Äù Matt Walsh, a conservative political commentator for the Daily Wire, told WIRED on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/maga-influencers-inauguration-victory-lap/"},

By around 7 am, it arrives at Lucius D. Clay Kaserne‚Äîthe US Army‚Äôs European headquarters and a key hub for US intelligence operations. The device stops near a restaurant before heading to an office near the base that belongs to a major government contractor responsible for outfitting and securing some of the nation‚Äôs most sensitive facilities. For roughly two months in 2023, this device followed a predictable routine: stops at the contractor‚Äôs office, visits to a discreet hangar on base, and lunchtime trips to the base‚Äôs dining facility. Twice in November of last year, it made a 30-minute drive to the Dagger Complex, a former intelligence and NSA signals processing facility. On weekends, the device could be traced to restaurants and shops in Wiesbaden. This article is published in collaboration with WIRED,  Bayerischer Rundfunk , and  Netzpolitik.org . The individual carrying this device likely isn‚Äôt a spy or high-ranking intelligence official. Instead, experts believe, they‚Äôre a contractor who works on critical systems‚ÄîHVAC, computing infrastructure, or possibly securing the newly built Consolidated Intelligence Center, a state-of-the-art facility suspected to be used by the National Security Agency. Whoever they are, the device they‚Äôre carrying with them everywhere is putting US national security at risk. A joint investigation by WIRED, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), and Netzpolitik.org reveals that US companies legally collecting digital advertising data are also providing the world a cheap and reliable way to track the movements of American military and intelligence personnel overseas, from their homes and their children‚Äôs schools to hardened aircraft shelters within an airbase where US nuclear weapons are believed to be stored. A collaborative analysis of billions of location coordinates obtained from a US-based data broker provides extraordinary insight into the daily routines of US service members. The findings also provide a vivid example of the significant risks the unregulated sale of mobile location data poses to the integrity of the US military and the safety of its service members and their families overseas. We tracked hundreds of thousands of signals from devices inside sensitive US installations in Germany. That includes scores of devices within suspected NSA monitoring or signals-analysis facilities, more than a thousand devices at a sprawling US compound where Ukrainian troops  were being being trained in 2023 , and nearly 2,000 others at an air force base that has crucially supported American drone operations. A device likely tied to an NSA or intelligence employee broadcast coordinates from inside a windowless building with a metal exterior known as the ‚ÄúTin Can,‚Äù which is reportedly used for NSA surveillance, according to agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden. Another device transmitted signals from within a restricted weapons testing facility, revealing its zig-zagging movements across a high-security zone used for tank maneuvers and live munitions drills. We traced these devices from barracks to work buildings, Italian restaurants, Aldi grocery stores, and bars. As many as four devices that regularly pinged from Ramstein Air Base were later tracked to nearby brothels off base, including a multistory facility called SexWorld. Experts caution that foreign governments could use this data to identify individuals with access to sensitive areas; terrorists or criminals could decipher when US nuclear weapons are least guarded; or spies and other nefarious actors could leverage embarrassing information for blackmail. ‚ÄúThe unregulated data broker industry poses a clear threat to national security,‚Äù says Ron Wyden, a US senator from Oregon with more than 20 years overseeing intelligence work. ‚ÄúIt is outrageous that American data brokers are selling location data collected from thousands of brave members of the armed forces who serve in harms‚Äô way around the world.‚Äù Wyden approached the US Defense Department in September after  initial reporting  by BR and netzpolitik.org raised concerns about the tracking of potential US service members. DoD failed to respond. Likewise, Wyden's office has yet to hear back from members of US president Joe Biden's National Security Council, despite repeated inquiries. The NSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ‚ÄúThere is ample blame to go around,‚Äù says Wyden, ‚Äúbut unless the incoming administration and Congress act, these kinds of abuses will keep happening, and they'll cost service members' lives.‚Äù The Oregon senator also raised the issue earlier this year with the Federal Trade Commission, following an FTC order that imposed unprecedented restrictions against a US company it accused of gathering data around ‚Äúsensitive locations.‚Äù Douglas Farrar, the FTC's director of public affairs, declined a request to comment. WIRED can now report for the first time, however, that the FTC is on the verge of fulfilling Wyden's request. An FTC source, granted anonymity to discuss internal matters, says the agency is planning to file multiple lawsuits soon that will formally recognize US military installations as protected sites. The source adds that the lawsuits are in keeping with years' worth of work by FTC Chair Lina Khan aimed at shielding US consumers‚Äîincluding service members‚Äîfrom harmful surveillance practices. Before a targeted  ad appears on an app or website, third-party software often embedded in apps called software development kits transmit information about their users to data brokers, real-time bidding platforms, and ad exchanges‚Äîoften including location data. Data brokers often will collect that data, analyze it, repackage it, and sell it. In February of 2024, reporters from BR and Netzpolitik.org obtained a free sample of this kind of data from Datastream Group, a Florida-based data broker. The dataset contains 3.6 billion coordinates‚Äîsome recorded at millisecond intervals‚Äîfrom up to 11 million mobile advertising IDs in Germany over what the company says is a 59-day span from October through December 2023. Mobile advertising IDs are unique identifiers used by the advertising industry to serve personalized ads to smartphones. These strings of letters and numbers allow companies to track user behavior and target ads effectively. However, mobile advertising IDs can also reveal much more sensitive information, particularly when combined with precise geolocation data. In total, our analysis revealed granular location data from up to 12,313 devices that appeared to spend time at or near at least 11 military and intelligence sites, potentially exposing crucial details like entry points, security practices, and guard schedules‚Äîinformation that, in the hands of hostile foreign governments or terrorists, could be deadly. Our investigation uncovered 38,474 location signals from up to 189 devices inside B√ºchel Air Base, a high-security German installation where as many as 15 US nuclear weapons are reportedly stored in underground bunkers. At Grafenw√∂hr Training Area, where thousands of US troops are stationed and have trained Ukrainian soldiers on Abrams tanks, we tracked 191,415 signals from up to 1,257 devices. At Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, the US Army‚Äôs European headquarters, we identified 74,968 location signals from as many as 799 devices, including some at the European Technical Center, once the NSA‚Äôs communication hub in Europe. Courtesy of OpenMapTiles In Wiesbaden, home to the US Army‚Äôs European headquarters at Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, 74,968 location signals from as many as 799 devices were detected‚Äîsome originating from sensitive intelligence facilities like the European Technical Center, once the NSA‚Äôs communication hub in Europe, and newly built intelligence operations centers. At Ramstein Air Base, which supports some US drone operations, 164,223 signals from nearly 2,000 devices were tracked. That included devices tracked to Ramstein Elementary and High School, base schools for the children of military personnel. Of these devices, 1,326 appeared at more than one of these highly sensitive military sites, potentially mapping the movements of US service members across Europe‚Äôs most secure locations. The data is not infallible. Mobile ad IDs can be reset, meaning multiple IDs can be assigned to the same device. Our analysis found that, in some instances, devices were assigned more than 10 mobile ad IDs. The location data‚Äôs precision at the individual device level can also be inconsistent. By contacting several people whose movements were revealed in the dataset, the reporting collective confirmed that much of the data was highly accurate‚Äîidentifying work commutes and dog walks of individuals contacted. However, this wasn‚Äôt always the case. One reporter whose ID appears in the dataset found that it often placed him a block away from his apartment and during times when he was out of town.  A study  from NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence found that ‚Äúquantity overshadows quality‚Äù in the data broker industry and that, on average, only up to 60 percent of the data surveyed can be considered precise. According to its website,  Datastream Group  appears to offer ‚Äúinternet advertising data coupled with hashed emails, cookies, and mobile location data.‚Äù Its listed datasets include niche categories like boat owners, mortgage seekers, and cigarette smokers. The company, one of many in a multibillion-dollar location-data industry, did not respond to our request for comment about the data it provided on US military and intelligence personnel in Germany, where the US maintains a force of at least  35,000 troops , according to the most recent estimates. Defense Department officials have known about the threat that commercial data brokers pose to national security since at least 2016, when Mike Yeagley,  a government contractor and technologist , delivered a briefing to senior military officials at the Joint Special Operations Command compound in Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg), North Carolina, about the issue. Yeagley‚Äôs presentation aimed to show how commercially available mobile data‚Äîalready pervasive in conflict zones like Syria‚Äîcould be weaponized for pattern of life analysis. Midway through the presentation, Yeagley decided to raise the stakes. ‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs the behavior of an ISIS operator,‚Äù he tells WIRED, recalling his presentation. ‚ÄúLet me turn the mirror around‚Äîlet me show you how it works for your own personnel.‚Äù He then displayed data revealing phones as they moved from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Florida‚Äîcritical hubs for elite US special operations units. The devices traveled through transit points like Turkey before clustering in northern Syria at a seemingly abandoned cement factory near Kobane, a known ISIS stronghold. The location he pinpointed was a covert forward operating base. Yeagley says he was quickly escorted to a secured room to continue his presentation behind closed doors. There, officials questioned him on how he had obtained the data, concerned that his stunt had involved hacking personnel or unauthorized intercepts. The data wasn‚Äôt sourced from espionage but from unregulated commercial brokers, he explained to the concerned DOD officials. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hack, intercept, or engineer this data,‚Äù he told them. ‚ÄúI bought it.‚Äù Now, years later, Yeagley remains deeply frustrated with the DODs inability to control the situation. What WIRED, BR, and Netzpolitik.org are now reporting is ‚Äúvery similar to the alarms we raised almost 10 years ago,‚Äù he says, shaking his head. ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything‚Äôs changed.‚Äù US law requires  the director of national intelligence to provide ‚Äúprotection support‚Äù for the personal devices of ‚Äúat risk‚Äù intelligence personnel who are deemed susceptible to ‚Äúhostile information collection activities.‚Äù But which personnel meet this criteria is unclear, as is the extent of the protections beyond periodic training and advice. The location data we acquired demonstrates, regardless, that commercial surveillance is far too pervasive and complex to be reduced to individual responsibility. Biden‚Äôs outgoing director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, did not respond to a request for comment. A report  declassified by Haines last summer  acknowledges that US intelligence agencies had purchased a ‚Äúlarge amount‚Äù of ‚Äúsensitive and intimate information‚Äù about US citizens from commercial data brokers, adding that ‚Äúin the wrong hands,‚Äù the data could ‚Äúfacilitate blackmail, stalking, harassment, and public shaming.‚Äù The report, which contains numerous redactions, notes that, while the US government \"would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times,‚Äù smartphones, connected cars, and web tracking have all made this possible ‚Äúwithout government participation.‚Äù Mike Rogers, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for Adam Smith, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Smith was unavailable to discuss the matter, busy negotiating a must-pass bill to fund the Pentagon's policy priorities next year. Jack Reed and Roger Wicker, the leading Democrat and Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, respectively, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Inquiries placed with House and Senate leaders and top lawmakers on both congressional intelligence committees have gone unanswered. The DOD and the NSA declined to answer specific questions related to our investigation. However, DOD spokesperson Javan Rasnake says that the Pentagon is aware that geolocation services could put personnel at risk and urged service members to remember their training and adhere strictly to operational security protocols. ‚ÄúWithin the USEUCOM region, members are reminded of the need to execute proper OPSEC when conducting mission activities inside operational areas,‚Äù Rasnake says, using the shorthand for operational security. An internal Pentagon presentation obtained by the reporting collective, though, claims that not only is the domestic data collection likely capable of revealing military secrets, it is essentially unavoidable at the personal level, service members‚Äô lives being simply too intertwined with the technology permitting it. This conclusion closely mirrors the observations of Chief Justice John Roberts of the US Supreme Court, who in landmark privacy cases within the past decade described cell phones as being a ‚Äúpervasive and insistent part of daily life‚Äù and that owning one was ‚Äúindispensable to participation in modern society.‚Äù The presentation, which a source says was delivered to high-ranking general officers, including the US Army‚Äôs chief information officer, warns that despite promises from major ad tech companies, ‚Äúde-anonymization‚Äù is all but trivial given the widespread availability of commercial data collected on Pentagon employees. The document emphasizes that the caches of location data on US individuals is a ‚Äúforce protection issue,‚Äù likely capable of revealing troop movements and other highly guarded military secrets. While instances of blackmail inside the Pentagon have seen a sharp decline since the Cold War, many of the structural barriers to persistently surveilling Americans have also vanished. In recent decades, US courts have repeatedly found that new technologies pose a threat to privacy by enabling surveillance that, ‚Äúin earlier times, would have been prohibitively expensive,\" as the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in 2007. In an August 2024 ruling, another US appeals court disregarded claims by tech companies that users who ‚Äúopt in‚Äù to surveillance were actually ‚Äúinformed‚Äù and doing so ‚Äúvoluntarily,‚Äù declaring the opposite is clear to ‚Äúanyone with a smartphone.‚Äù The internal presentation for military staff presses that adversarial nations can gain access to advertising data with ease, using it to exploit, manipulate, and coerce military personnel for purposes of espionage. Patronizing sex workers,  whether legal in a foreign country or not, is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The penalties can be severe, including forfeiture of pay, dishonorable discharge, and up to one year of imprisonment. But the ban on solicitation is not merely imposed on principle alone, says Michael Waddington, a criminal defense attorney who specializes in court-marial cases. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a genuine danger of encountering foreign agents in these establishments, which can lead to blackmail or exploitation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis issue is particularly concerning given the current geopolitical climate. Many US servicemembers in Europe are involved in supporting Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion,‚Äù Waddington says. ‚ÄúAny compromise of their integrity could have serious implications for our operations and national security.‚Äù When it comes to jeopardizing national security, even data on low-level personnel can pose a risk, says Vivek Chilukuri, senior fellow and program director of the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). Before joining CNAS, Chilukuri served in part as legislative director and tech policy advisor to US senator Michael Bennet on the Senate Intelligence Committee and previously worked at the US State Department, specializing in countering violent extremism. \"Low-value targets can lead to high-value compromises,\" Chilukuri says. \"Even if someone isn't senior in an organization, they may have access to highly sensitive infrastructure. A system is only as secure as its weakest link.\" He points out that if adversaries can target someone with access to a crucial server or database, they could exploit that vulnerability to cause serious damage. ‚ÄúIt just takes one USB stick plugged into the right device to compromise an organization.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just individual service members who are at risk‚Äîentire security protocols and operational routines can be exposed through location data. At B√ºchel Air Base, where the US is believed to have stored an estimated 10 to 15 B61 nuclear weapons, the data reveals the daily activity patterns of devices on the base, including when personnel are most active and, more concerningly, potentially when the base is least populated. Overview of the Air Mobility Command ramp at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. \n Photograph: Timm Ziegenthaler/Stocktrek Images; Getty Images B√ºchel has 11 protective aircraft shelters equipped with hardened vaults for nuclear weapons storage. Each vault, which is located in a so-called WS3, or Weapons Storage and Security System, can hold up to four warheads. Our investigation traced precise location data for as many as 40 cellular devices that were present in or near these bunkers. The patterns we could observe from devices at B√ºchel go far beyond just understanding the working hours of people on base. In aggregate, it's possible to map key entry and exit points, pinpointing frequently visited areas, and even tracing personnel to their off-base routines. For a terrorist, this information could be a gold mine‚Äîan opportunity to identify weak points, plan an attack, or target individuals with access to sensitive areas. This month,  German authorities arrested  a former civilian contractor employed by the US military on allegations of offering to pass sensitive information about American military operations in Germany to Chinese intelligence agencies. In April, German authorities  arrested two German-Russian nationals  accused of scouting US military sites for potential sabotage, including allegedly arson. One of the targeted locations was the US Army's Grafenw√∂hr Training Area in Bavaria, a critical hub for US military operations in Europe that spans 233 square kilometers. At Grafenw√∂hr, WIRED, BR, and Netzpolitik.org could track the precise movements from up to 1,257 devices. Some devices could even be observed zigzagging through Range 301, an armored vehicle course, before returning to nearby barracks. Our investigation found 38,474 location signals from up to 189 devices inside B√ºchel Air Base, around a dozen US nuclear weapons are reportedly stored. Courtesy of OpenMapTiles A senior fellow at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy and head of its data brokerage research project, Justin Sherman also leads Global Cyber Strategies, a firm specializing in cybersecurity and tech policy. In 2023, he and his coauthors at Duke secured $250,000 in funding from the United States Military Academy to investigate how easy it is to purchase sensitive data about military personnel from data brokers. The results were alarming: They were able to buy highly sensitive, nonpublic, individually identifiable health and financial data on active-duty service members, without any vetting. ‚ÄúIt shows you how bad the situation is,‚Äù Sherman says, explaining how they geofenced requests to specific special operations bases. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt pretend to be a marketing firm in LA. We just wanted to see what the data brokers would ask.‚Äù Most brokers didn‚Äôt question their requests, and one even offered to bypass an ID verification check if they paid by wire. During the study, Sherman helped draft an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that requires the Defense Department to ensure that highly identifiable individual data shared with contractors cannot be resold. He found the overall impact of the study underwhelming, however. ‚ÄúThe scope of the industry is the problem,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to pass focused controls on parts of the ecosystem, but if you don‚Äôt address the rest of the industry, you leave the door wide open for anyone wanting location data on intelligence officers.‚Äù Efforts by the US Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation have been stalled for the better part of a decade. The latest effort, known as the American Privacy Rights Act, failed to advance in June after GOP leaders threatened to scuttle the bill, which was significantly weakened before being shelved. Another current privacy bill, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, seeks to ban the US government from purchasing data on Americans that it would normally need a warrant to obtain. While the bill would not prohibit the sale of commercial location data altogether, it would bar federal agencies from using those purchases to circumvent constitutional protections upheld by the Supreme Court. Its fate rests in the hands of House and Senate leaders, whose negotiations are private. ‚ÄúThe government needs to stop subsidizing what is now for good reason one of the world's least popular industries,‚Äù says Sean Vitka, policy director at the nonprofit Demand Progress. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of members of Congress who take seriously the severe threats to privacy and national security posed by data brokers, but we've seen many actions by congressional leaders that only furthers the problem. There shouldn't need to be a body count for these people to take action.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/phone-data-us-soldiers-spies-nuclear-germany/"},

It could easily have been the trailer for any one of a seemingly endless stream of Hollywood movies about threats to the life of the American president starring Gerald Butler or Morgan Freeman; instead, it‚Äôs a 35-second hype video for  the second presidency of Donald Trump . Even before Trump was officially sworn in as 47th President of the United States on Monday, his team had taken control of the official White House website. Just after midday Eastern time on Monday, visitors were greeted with a graphic of the White House before the auto-playing video took over the entire screen, ensuring that every visitor was clear on just who was now in charge of the country. When the video finishes, it is replaced by a giant image of Trump pointing into the distance with the words ‚ÄúAmerica Is Back‚Äù superimposed on top. ‚ÄúEvery single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body,‚Äù text on the site reads. ‚ÄúI will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve.

Biden pardoned his brother James and his wife, Sara, his sister Valerie and her husband, John Owens, and his brother Francis.

Just days before he took office,  Trump launched a memecoin  called $TRUMP to ‚Äúcelebrate our win and have fun,\" warning that it was ‚Äúnot intended to be ‚Ä¶ an investment opportunity.‚Äù Trump announced the launch on X and Truth Social, with many wondering if the president‚Äôs accounts  had been hacked . However, within hours, thousands had invested in the cryptocurrency. The sale was so successful  that, at billions of dollars, it accounted for almost 90  percent of Trump‚Äôs overall wealth. However, like a lot of memecoins, the $TRUMP coin‚Äôs price fluctuated wildly and dipped significantly on Sunday, with the price drop continuing into Monday. At the time he was sworn in as president on Monday,  the $TRUMP memecoin was worth  just shy of $50 billion, with Trump retaining 80 percent of the coins. The coin, which is built on the Solana blockchain, allows anyone anywhere in the world to funnel money directly to the US president. First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin on Sunday, and while it hasn‚Äôt reached the level of Trump‚Äôs memecoin, the  $MELANIA coin  was worth almost $8 billion on Monday. The president and first lady were far from the only ones seeking to cash in on the buzz around Trump‚Äôs second term, and the inauguration weekend in particular. Since his first term in office, Trump has been a magnet for all types of grifts and cash grabs, many of them endorsed by the president himself, and including everything from guitars and shoes to trading cards and coins. Religion has also been on the table. Lee Greenwood, a country singer, said on Sunday that Trump could use a special edition of the  ‚ÄúGod Bless The USA‚Äù bible  for his swearing in‚Äîthe same bible the singer has been selling with Trump since last March. The ‚ÄúInauguration Day Edition Bible‚Äù has been on sale on Greenwood‚Äôs own website‚Äîalongside hot-pink and camo versions of the bible‚Äîfor $70 for the last week, but as Trump took office on Monday, the bible appeared to have already sold out. A raft of other commemorative items are on sale, ranging from dozens of ‚ÄúInauguration Day‚Äù T-shirts and hats being sold on platforms like Amazon and Etsy to a special ‚ÄúInauguration Edition‚Äù roast from Victory Coffee. A Texas-based jeweler is even offering to gift the president an 8-carat diamond in the shape of his head in what appears to be a marketing bid. And because Trump‚Äôs inauguration was moved indoors due to severe cold weather, tens of thousands of people who had been sent tickets to attend the event were unable to use them. People have attempted to cash in on those tickets, with dozens of listings on eBay offering the unused tickets for up to $200 each. The tickets were distributed free by members of the House of Representatives and feature a hologram and the signature of the representative whose office issued them. Many of the listings have already been sold, with some sellers offering multiple tickets. A specific website offering commemorative inaugural tickets was also set up, with some tickets offered for as much as $900. It is unclear who is behind the page, but the site is ranked as the second result on a Google search for \"commemorative inauguration tickets.‚Äù Grifting  and cash grabs in Trumpworld are nothing new. Ever since Trump came to office in 2016, he and his sycophantic supporters have embraced a wide variety of schemes. With Trump support, many figures have made entire careers grifting on  topics like stolen elections  or  Covid denialism .", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-grift/"},

His team is asking the crypto industry to weigh in on potential picks, according to sources who claim to be close to proceedings. Trump‚Äôs shortlist is filled with former government officials, crypto executives, and lawyers who support the crypto industry: Paul Atkins, former SEC commissioner, and Brian Brooks, former acting US comptroller of the currency, are the top two contenders, sources familiar tell WIRED, but the vetting process is ongoing. Other candidates include SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda, former SEC general counsel Robert Stebbins, and Brad Bondi, the global cochair of investigations and white collar defense at the law firm Paul Hastings, WIRED understands. The chief legal officer for Robinhood, Dan Gallagher, was also up for the role but  bowed out  of the race over the weekend. Uyeda declined to comment. Neither the Trump transition team, Atkins, Brooks, Stebbins, nor Bondi responded to a request for comment. To help craft policy and implement his campaign pledges, Trump is also expected to appoint a crypto czar. The czar would lead a board of advisers comprising a colorful cast of crypto characters, sources tell WIRED. A variety of industry leaders are rumored to be in line for a position on the panel, from companies like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken, as well as pro-crypto venture capital firms and crypto mining outfits. Jonathan Jachym, global head of policy and government relations at Kraken, declined to comment on the competition for places on the advisory council, but says the company welcomes the opportunity to steer crypto policy under the Trump administration. ‚ÄúWe take our leadership role in the industry very seriously, and that includes informing and driving regulatory clarity and policy outcomes,‚Äù he says. Gemini declined to comment. Coinbase did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Under Gary Gensler, the sitting SEC chair, the crypto industry has faced what many in its ranks  allege  to be an  unjust and targeted barrage of litigation . Among the crypto faithful, Gensler has become something of a cartoon villain. Tyler Winklevoss, cofounder of crypto exchange Gemini, recently went as far as to describe him as ‚Äú evil .‚Äù In July, at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump  pledged to fire Gensler  if reelected, drawing perhaps the most raucous applause of the night. ‚ÄúI will appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future,‚Äù Trump said. Last week, Gensler  announced that he would resign  from his office on January 20, the day of Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Representatives of the industry in which Gensler has become so maligned are now helping to pick out his successor, sources tell WIRED. The promise of an SEC overhaul was one of many made to the crypto industry by Trump on the campaign trail. At the Nashville conference, he pledged to cement the US as the foremost bitcoin mining powerhouse, create a national ‚Äú bitcoin stockpile ,‚Äù and establish a framework for stablecoin businesses, singing from the crypto hymn sheet. In June, Trump  hosted executives from the crypto mining industry  at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida. ‚ÄúWe had a very long, in-depth discussion with him‚Äîand he was very interested. He was very engaged and asked great questions,‚Äù says Brian Morgenstern, head of public policy at bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms and a former official in the first Trump administration, who was in attendance. Trump has even begun to dabble in crypto himself. Over the summer, his campaign began accepting crypto donations, and his sons  launched their own crypto platform , World Liberty Financial, which he helped to promote. Last Thursday,  The New York Times reported  that Trump‚Äôs social media company, Truth Social, filed a trademark application for what was described as a crypto payment service called TruthFi. Figures allied with the crypto industry have already been appointed to Trump‚Äôs cabinet. His pick for Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, leads the financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, which manages assets for Tether, operator of the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin. Likewise, vice president-elect JD Vance, nominee for Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and coleader of the new Department of Government Efficiency Vivek Ramaswamy have all expressed pro-crypto views. ‚ÄúBased on what I've heard in private conversations, my perspective has been that the incoming administration is taking their pro-bitcoin and crypto campaign promises very seriously and intend to do a robust assessment of options to optimize [appointments to regulatory positions] as best they can,‚Äù says Christopher Calicott, managing director at bitcoin-focused VC firm Trammell Venture Partners. The price of bitcoin has  risen to record heights , just shy of $100,000 per coin, since Trump won reelection earlier this month. ‚ÄúThe entire industry is going to have much brighter prospects on a number of different fronts,‚Äù says Morgenstern. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any reason to doubt President Trump.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-candidates-front-runners-sec-race/"},

This year,  far-right extremists , MAGAworld, and conspiracists are all jumping on  the Black Friday bandwagon  to try and persuade their followers to buy untested health supplements, unfunny novelty mugs, and guns‚Äîlots and lots of guns. Rather than advertising on mainstream online marketplaces offered by sites including Google or Facebook, these groups are targeting their audience where they live, on fringe and alternative online platforms with little or no moderation. Spaces like  Gab , a white-supremacist-friendly social network run by a christian nationalist. Or  Telegram , where election deniers and neo-Nazi groups happily sit side-by-side despite new  privacy changes being introduced  this year. And of course,Trump‚Äôs own  Truth Social , where his most devoted followers can be found. Gab and Truth Social did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn said that ads placed through the Telegram Ads platform are vetted before they are shown. For those feeling a little drained after Thanksgiving, alternative health company Exodus Strong is offering discounts on a dietary supplement which has ‚Äú7 Biblically-inspired ingredients and a molecular hydrogen generating blend that optimize your Mind and Body to function the way God intended.‚Äù The tablets, which are currently being advertised up to 60 percent off on Truth Social, include, among other biblical ingredients, frankincense and myrrh. Those who purchase one of these supplements will even get a free gift: a prayer plan. Undermining the boasts about the product slightly, however, is the disclaimer on the company‚Äôs own website that reads: ‚ÄúThese products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.‚Äù Launched just in time for Black Friday, the new online store from right-wing  YouTube-alternative Rumble  features a who‚Äôs who of conspiracy theorists and conservative agitators on its front page, including  Trump confidante Laura Loomer  and  underpants-wearing baptiser Russell Brand . The store itself is a cornucopia of unimagined gems, everything from Faraday cages for your phone to stop 5G melting your brain, to nuclear fallout preparedness kits for the bargain price of $349. Rumble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Many far-right and conspiracy newsletters and subscription services are offering huge discounts to lock in their audiences for the next 12 months. Gab for example is offering 50 percent discounts on yearly subscriptions to its AI service, whose racist chatbots have been  trained to deny the Holocaust . An antisemitic Irish blogger who is  a close ally of white supremacist Nick Fuentes  is offering 40 percent off his Substack subscriptions directly to his existing readers, showing that the effort to cash in on Black Friday hype is not limited to extremists in the US. By far the most popular Black Friday ads on these platforms are from gun manufacturers, who are offering huge discounts on everything from high-powered rifles to a pink ‚Äúno drill cheek rest‚Äù for your scoped long gun. (The ‚ÄúMAGA Patriot,‚Äù  a Trump-themed AR-15  that was created in the wake of the  president-elect surviving an assassination attempt  by the same gun, is not discounted for Black Friday.) Some of these promotions are simply flogging pro-MAGA paraphernalia. On Truth Social, Fox News host Sean Hannity is promoting the Black Friday deals available in his own merch store. From coffee cups with the phrase ‚Äúleftist tears‚Äù to a ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs Home‚Äù T-shirt featuring a picture of Trump in front of the White House wearing a hot-pink jacket, Hannity has something for all tastes‚Äîas long as those tastes align with a pro-Trump, MAGA, Christian nationalist view of America. For those Trump supporters who may be missing the glory days of 2020 when they could come together online to  rage against the voting machines  for stealing the election, conspiracy group  Audit the Vote PA  has got you covered with a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‚Äúelection denier,‚Äù advertised on Gab. And the biggest election denier of them all, pillow salesman  Mike Lindell , is, of course, having a massive Black Friday sale. The man who has  sponsored huge swathes of the far-right media ecosystem  with promotional codes for the last four years is now offering a two-pack of ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù pillow covers for just $25. On these alternative platforms, discussions about Black Friday are not only about getting 50 percent off ‚ÄúMake Christmas Great Again‚Äù T-shirts. Those promotions are interspersed with incredibly antisemitic and racist posts about the day, including several featuring children in black face. Some users of Gab and Truth Social are also pushing back against Black Friday, calling out the ‚Äúderanged libtards who turn into dangerous NCPs‚Äù during the event (misspelling NPC, which is used to describe someone who is predictable or robotic.) Others insist they are ‚Äúboycotting Black Friday‚Äù because it‚Äôs a cash grab by the globalist elite. And of course, conspiracies are never far away. One user on Trump‚Äôs Truth Social, who calls themselves ‚ÄúTrust the Plan‚Äù (spelled like trusttheplqn), believes they have uncovered a secret message in one store‚Äôs Black Friday promotional material based on ‚Äúintel‚Äù provided by another Truth Social account called Entheos. The conspiracy theory centers on the store promoting a ‚Äústorewide blackout‚Äù for Black Friday, which ‚ÄúTrust the Plan‚Äù believes is code for something sinister taking place, though they fail to say exactly what this is. ‚ÄúBlack friday is on the 29th, but their sale starts on 27th (date that Entheos gave). And why would there be a ‚Äòblackout storewide‚Äô for black friday? You want complete opposite of a blackout...so people can actually shop.‚Äù For others however, the situation appears much more dire. One Gab poster shared an article from a conspiracy site discussing a ‚Äúglobal escalation‚Äù on Friday.

But on Sunday night, these words, which were Trump‚Äôs first mention of the January 6 prisoners since the election, carried particular significance. Trump had just announced that he plans to nominate staunch loyalist and January 6 sympathizer Kash Patel to run the FBI. (Current FBI director Christopher Wray‚Äôs term ends in 2027; whether Trump intends to fire him or expects him to resign isn‚Äôt clear.) Patel, a former federal prosecutor who worked in a variety of national security roles during Trump‚Äôs first term, is an author of the children‚Äôs book series ‚ÄúThe Plot Against the King,‚Äù which is about Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeep State‚Äù enemies, and sells pro-Trump merchandise under the brand name K$H. ‚ÄúI think January 6 individuals, those in jail, those in the legal pipeline, will be ecstatic over this,‚Äù says Denver Riggleman, a former Republican congressman from Virginia who served as an adviser to the Select Committee investigating the events of January 6. ‚ÄúThey already bought into criminal activity on January 6, now they have someone who validates it, even excuses it. I think it makes them very happy.‚Äù Patel, who was chief of staff to acting defense secretary Christopher Miller on January 6, 2021, has  pushed  the baseless ‚Äúfedsurrection‚Äù conspiracy theory, which claims that undercover FBI agents instigated the Capitol riot with the goal of smearing the MAGA movement. Patel helped produce  ‚ÄúJustice for All, ‚Äù a single that features the ‚ÄúJ6 Prison Choir‚Äù singing the national anthem (a solemn nightly tradition for imprisoned rioters), mixed with Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The song became a mainstay of Trump‚Äôs campaign rallies. Patel has also proposed a ‚Äúfull-fledged investigation‚Äù into the January 6 Select Committee. He has even helped January 6ers via his nonprofit the Kash Foundation, which provides, among other things, legal defense funds to help ‚Äúdefamed American citizens.‚Äù Patel has also flirted with QAnon, defending its slogan ‚ÄúWWG1WGA‚Äù (where we go one, we go all), praising QAnon supporters, and  even appearing  on the high-profile QAnon podcast  X22 Report . Riggleman believes that Patel is Trump‚Äôs most dangerous selection to lead a major agency, on account of his blind loyalty to the former president and his public displays of interest in conspiracy theories. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs his worst pick, even worse than Matt Gaetz,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúKash Patel is simply a foot soldier for Trump.‚Äù For the sprawling community of January 6 activists‚Äîa smorgasbord of MAGA personalities, family members of jailed rioters, and rioters who‚Äôve completed their sentences‚ÄîTrump‚Äôs nomination of Patel is an indication that retribution is coming. And part of that retribution isn‚Äôt just about granting pardons and clemency to the rioters: It‚Äôs about going after those that put them behind bars in the first place. Since at least the 1990s and the Waco siege, the anti-government movement in America has viewed the FBI as its enemy. Trump‚Äôs first presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic took anti-government animus mainstream. That animus was turbocharged by the investigations and prosecutions of January 6-ers, as well as by the federal investigations of Trump. And the narrative that both Trump and January 6 defendants are ‚Äúpolitical prisoners‚Äù of a corrupt and tyrannical ‚ÄúBiden Regime,‚Äù hunted down by his personal Gestapo in FBI uniforms, took hold. The MAGA media ecosystem and network of J6 activists believe that Patel, if he takes the reins of the FBI, will root out corruption, expose all sorts of nefarious plots designed to damage Trump, and prove that J6 was a false flag. ‚ÄúThe FBI deserves Kash Patel,‚Äù wrote Suzzanne Monk, a prominent J6 advocate, on X. ‚ÄúThey earned the ass whoopin he's bringing.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat Kash Patel pick put the traitors in our government on notice,‚Äù wrote MAGA commentators The Hodge Twins on X. ‚ÄúHow many FBI agents were present for J6?‚Äù wrote Representative Mike Collins from Georgia, on X. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to find out.‚Äù Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, chimed in via a post that addressed Wray directly. ‚ÄúMr Wray. Remain close to DC. Your presence will be commanded,‚Äù Higgins wrote on X. ‚ÄúIn this Holiest of seasons, as you box up your mementos of oppression, may visions of the thousands of American J6 families you‚Äôve destroyed dance through your head.‚Äù Philip Anderson, an accused rioter facing federal and misdemeanor charges for January 6, said on X that they‚Äôll have to wait and see whether Patel and Trump put their money where their mouths are. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt taking you people seriously until you end the J6 prosecutions on Day One.‚Äù So far, beyond his Truth Social post, Trump hasn‚Äôt said much about whether he plans to make good on  his promises to grant pardons and clemency to January 6ers . Some hopeful defendants have sought to delay their proceedings or even drop charges entirely. Some lawyers are unsure whether Trump would pursue a blanket pardon for everyone involved in January 6, or grant pardons and clemency selectively based on, for example, the types of crimes people are accused of. Meanwhile, Riggleman suggests that Patel faces an uphill, if not impossible, battle to get confirmed as the head of the FBI. Patel‚Äôs  former colleagues  from various points in his career have questioned his competence to lead the agency. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anyone that‚Äôs sane, I don‚Äôt think the Senate will confirm him,‚Äù said Riggleman. ‚ÄúBut then again, there are senators who are very afraid of Donald Trump and their own reelection prospects.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/kash-patel-fbi-fedsurrection-january-6-rioters/"},

From the polio vaccine, to decoding the first human chromosome, to the first heart bypass surgery, American research has originated a seemingly endless list of health care advances that are taken for granted. But when the Trump administration issued a memorandum Monday that  paused all federal grants and loans ‚Äîwith the aim of ensuring that funding recipients are complying with the president‚Äôs raft of recent executive orders‚ÄîUS academia ground to a halt. Since then, the freeze has been partially rescinded for some sectors, but it largely remains in place for universities and research institutions across the country, with no certainty of what comes next. ‚ÄúThis has immediate impact on people‚Äôs lives,‚Äù says  J9 Austin , professor of psychiatry and medical genetics at the University of British Columbia. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs terrifying.‚Äù The funding freeze requires agencies to submit reviews of their funded programs to the Office of Management and Budget by February 10. The freeze follows separate orders issued last week to US health agencies‚Äîincluding to the National Institutes of Health, which leads the country‚Äôs medical research‚Äîto  pause all communications  until February 1 and  stop almost all travel indefinitely . The confusion is consummate. If the funding freeze continues through February, and even beyond, how will graduate students be paid? Should grant applications‚Äîyears long in the writing‚Äîstill be submitted by the triannual grant submission deadline on February 5? What does this mean for clinical trials if participants and lab techs can‚Äôt be paid? Will all that research have to be scrapped thanks to incomplete data? Even if Trump fully reverses the freeze on research funding, the damage, multiple sources say, has been done. Although for now the funding freeze is temporary, the administration has shown how it might wield the levers of government. The implication is that withdrawing funding could be done more permanently, and could be done to individual institutions, individual organizations, both private and public. This won‚Äôt just set a precedent for the large East Coast or West Coast universities, but those located in both red and blue states alike. While always an imperfect arrangement, science in the US is largely funded by a complex system of grant applications, reviews by peers in the field (both of which have had to be halted as part of the communications pause), and the competitive distribution of NIH funds, says Gerald Keusch, emeritus professor of medicine at Boston University and former associate director of international research for the NIH. According to its website, the NIH disburses nearly $48 billion in grants per year. When it comes to medical research, America truly is first, and if it abdicates that position, the void left behind has global ramifications. ‚ÄúIn Canada, we have always looked to NIH as an exemplar of what we should be trying to do,‚Äù says Austin, speaking to me independently of any roles and affiliations. ‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs collapsed.‚Äù Science is, in its very nature, collaborative. Many consortiums and alliances within scientific fields cross borders and language barriers. Some labs may be able to find additional funding from alternative sources such as the European Union. But it is unlikely that a continued withdrawal of NIH funding could be plugged by overseas support. And Big Pharma, with its seemingly endless funds, is unlikely to step up either, according to sources WIRED spoke with. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be handed off to drug companies or biotech, because they‚Äôre not interested in things that are as preclinical as a lot of the work we‚Äôre discussing here,‚Äù says a professor of genetics who agreed to speak anonymously out of fear of retribution. ‚ÄúEssentially, there‚Äôs a whole legion of university-based scientists who work super damn hard to try to figure out some basic stuff that eventually becomes something that a drug company can drop $100 million on.‚Äù The millions of dollars awarded to high-achieving labs is used to fund graduate students, lab techs, and analysts. If the principal investigator on a research team is unsuccessful in obtaining a grant through the process Keusch describes, often that lab is closed, and those ancillary team members lose their jobs. One of the potential downstream effects of an NIH funding loss, even if only temporary, is a mass domestic brain drain. ‚ÄúMany of those people are going to go out to find something else to do,‚Äù the professor of genetics says. ‚ÄúThese are just like jobs for anything else‚Äîwe can‚Äôt not pay people for a month. What would the food service industry be like, for example, or grocery stores, if they don‚Äôt pay somebody for a month? Their workers will leave, and pharma can only hire so many people.‚Äù WIRED heard over and over, from scientists too fearful for their teams and their jobs to speak on the record, that it won‚Äôt take long for the impact to reach the general population. With a loss of research funding comes the closure of hospitals and universities. And gains in medical advancement will likely falter too. Conditions being studied with NIH funding are not only rare diseases affecting 1 or 2 percent of the population. They‚Äôre problems such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs‚Äîissues that affect your grandmother, your friends, and so many people who will one day fall out of perfect health. It‚Äôs thanks to this research system, and the scientists working within it, that doctors know how to save someone from a heart attack, regulate diabetes, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of stroke. It‚Äôs how the world knows that smoking isn‚Äôt a good idea. ‚ÄúAll of that is knowledge that scientists funded by the NIH have generated, and if you throw this big of a wrench in it, it‚Äôs going to disrupt absolutely everything,‚Äù says the genetics professor. While some are hopeful that the funding freeze for academia could end on February 1, when the pause on communications and therefore grant reviews is slated to lift, the individuals WIRED spoke with are largely skeptical that work will simply resume as before. ‚ÄúWhen the wheels of government stop, it‚Äôs not like they turn on a dime and they just start up again,‚Äù says Julie Scofield, a former executive director of  NASTAD , a US-based health nonprofit. She adds that she has colleagues in Washington, DC, who have had funding returned to their fields, and yet remain unable to access payment through the management system. Austin says that already the international scientific community is holding hastily arranged online support groups. Topics covered range from the banal‚Äîwhat the most recent communication from the White House implies‚Äîto how best to protect trainees and the many students on international visas. But mostly they‚Äôre there to provide support. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a lot of messages from people just expressing gratitude that we could actually get together,‚Äù Austin says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just so much unaddressable need. None of us has the answers.‚Äù Scientists, perhaps more than any other profession, are trained to ‚Äúlearn and validate conclusions drawn from observation and experimentation,‚Äù says Keutsch. That applies to the current situation. And what they observe during this pause of chaos does not portend well for the future of the United States as a pinnacle of scientific excellence. ‚ÄúIf people want the United States to head toward being a second-class nation, this is exactly what to do. If the goal is, in fact, to make America great, this is not a way to do it,‚Äù says the genetics professor. ‚ÄúThis is not a rational, thoughtful, effective thing to do. It will merely destroy.‚Äù This story has been written under a pseudonym, as the reporter has specific and credible concerns about potential retaliation.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/life-saving-research-risks-being-destroyed-by-the-federal-funding-freeze/"},

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is proposing a rule that would allow regulators to  police data brokers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) , a landmark privacy law enacted more than a half century ago. Under the proposal, data brokers would be limited in their ability to sell certain sensitive personal information, including financial data and credit scores, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and addresses. The CFPB says that closing the loopholes allowing data brokers to trade in this data with little to no oversight will benefit vulnerable people and the US as a whole. ‚ÄúBy selling our most sensitive personal data without our knowledge or consent, data brokers can profit by enabling scamming, stalking, and spying,‚Äù Rohit Chopra, CFPB‚Äôs director, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe CFPB‚Äôs proposed rule will curtail these practices that threaten our personal safety and undermine America‚Äôs national security.‚Äù Passed in 1970 as the first US privacy law, the FCRA requires ‚Äúcredit reporting agencies‚Äù to adhere to certain standards of accuracy and privacy in their dealing with people‚Äôs financial information, including credit histories, credit scores, debt payment histories, and other related data. The CFPB‚Äôs proposal aims to treat data brokers like credit reporting agencies when they deal in this sensitive data. It would require data brokers to obtain ‚Äúseparate, explicit authorization‚Äù before acquiring or sharing people‚Äôs credit information, rather than burying these permissions in expansive legal documents that  surveys show  are often unread or impossible for the average person to parse. In a conversation with reporters on Monday, Chopra pointed to the recent attacks on US telecommunications systems, which the government has attributed to China, to emphasize the value of personal data to the nation's foreign rivals. ‚ÄúBut often, our adversaries don't need to hack anything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúData brokers, the outfits that collect and sell detailed information about our personal and financial lives, are making this data available to anyone willing to pay a price.‚Äù The action proposed by the CFPB is aimed, Chopra says, at stopping data brokers from ‚Äúenabling scammers, stalkers and spies undermining our personal safety and America's national security.‚Äù The CFPB‚Äôs idea of using existing US law to regulate data brokers is not novel. In February 2023, a group of consumer-focused nonprofits urged Chopra to enforce the powers the FCRA affords regulators to prevent data brokers from engaging in these potentially damaging practices. ‚ÄúProtecting the personal information of all people in the US is increasingly urgent in our current political climate,‚Äù says Laura Rivera, attorney with Just Futures Law, a nonprofit that supports grassroots activists. ‚ÄúThe stakes are too high to continue to let the data broker industry sell our information at their discretion, where the status quo has made it ripe for abuse and targeting from harmful actors.‚Äù In a briefing with WIRED on Monday, CFPB officials declined to comment on whether they believe the regulatory action will be short lived, as president-elect Donald Trump plans to empower a number of Silicon Valley figures to reorganize the federal government with the aim of targeting ‚Äúwaste and fraud.‚Äù Elon Musk, who is coleading an office named after a meme coin‚Äîthe Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE‚Äî directly attacked  the CFPB's work last week, calling for the agency to be ‚Äúdeleted.‚Äù Musk's remarks followed an attack on the agency's work by Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, who claimed on  a recent episode of Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast  that the agency is ‚Äúterrorizing‚Äù banking startups. The CFBP was founded in 2011 with the aim of protecting consumers from the kinds of fraud and abuse that kicked off the 2008 financial crisis. A CFPB official tells WIRED that the agency is also concerned about data being transmitted in ways that companies allege protects people's identities but in reality can be \"de-anonymized\" in simple ways, as studies have repeatedly shown. \"As technology advances, we surmise that it will be even easier to de-mask purportedly de-identified data,\" one official said. The proposed rule thus includes a range of guidelines for credit reporting agencies involved in selling data they alleged has been de-identified. Asked whether the proposal would extend to US government agencies, an official says that US law sets forth \"very clear pathways\" for the government to purchase personally identifying data for law enforcement and intelligence purposes. In a recent case, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was  discovered by reporters  to have purchased access to the personal data of Americans in an attempt to investigate immigrants‚Äîdata acquired by the media conglomerate Thomson Reuters, which it provided to custeroms in contracts the company disclosed were worth more than $100 million. (Thomson Reuters  previously denied  that the purpose of the data is to track undocumented immigrants and has emphasized that its database does not contain information that normally requires a search warrant to access.) ‚ÄúWe are not disrupting any of those pathways,‚Äù a CFPB official says. The agency is requesting comment, however, on the potential impacts of such government purchases to ensure that access is ‚Äúappropriate.‚Äù Emily Peterson-Cassin, director of corporate power at the nonprofit advocacy group Demand Progress‚Äôs Education Fund, commended the CFPB‚Äôs proposal and urged the incoming Trump administration to see it through. ‚ÄúThe CFPB is doing something important that will resonate with every single American. Anyone you pick off the street can tell you about the daily scam texts, emails and calls they receive from fraudsters who easily buy our contact information from shady, unaccountable data brokers,‚Äù Peterson-Cassin says. ‚ÄúFinally, someone‚Äîspecifically the CFPB‚Äîhas stepped in to stop this daily plague affecting hundreds of millions of people by applying real standards to their sale of our sensitive information.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-fcra-data-broker-oversight/"},

The data was used, the agency says, to track Americans in and around churches,  military bases , and doctors‚Äô offices, among other protected sites. It was sold not only for advertising purposes but also for political campaigns and government uses, including  immigration enforcement . Mobilewalla, a Georgia-based data broker that‚Äôs said to have digitally tracked the residents of domestic abuse shelters, is accused by the agency of purposefully tracking protesters in the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs murder in 2020. In a court filing, the FTC says Mobilewalla attempted to unmask the protesters‚Äô racial identities by tracking their mobile devices to, for example, Hindu temples and Black churches. The FTC also accused Gravy Analytics and its subsidiary Venntel of harvesting and exploiting consumers‚Äô location data without consent, alleging that the company used that data to unfairly infer health decisions and religious beliefs. According to the FTC, Gravy Analytics collected over 17 billion location signals from approximately a billion mobile devices daily. It has reportedly sold access to that data to federal law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Gravy Analytics could not be immediately reached for comment. A spokesperson for Mobilewalla says the company's privacy policies are constantly evolving, adding: ‚ÄúWhile we disagree with many of the FTC‚Äôs allegations and implications that Mobilewalla tracks and targets individuals based on sensitive categories, we are satisfied that the resolution will allow us to continue providing valuable insights to businesses in a manner that respects and protects consumer privacy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis data can be used to identify and target consumers based on their religion,‚Äù the FTC says. The location data collected by the two companies makes it possible, the agency says, to ‚Äúidentify where individual consumers lived, worked, and worshipped, thus suggesting the mobile device user‚Äôs religion and routine and identifying the user‚Äôs friends and families.‚Äù According to the two settlements, which must be finalized in court before they would go into effect, Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla are barred from collecting sensitive location data from consumers and must delete the historical data they gathered on millions of Americans. Mobilewalla would be banned from acquiring location data and other sensitive information from online auctions known as real-time bidding exchanges, marketplaces where advertisers compete to instantaneously deliver ads to targeted consumers. This case marks the first time the FTC has moved to police the collection of data directly from an ad exchange. In another first, the proposed Gravy Analytics settlement would introduce military installations to the list of ‚Äúsensitive locations‚Äù where the FTC bans location tracking. Under the terms, the company would be prohibited from selling, disclosing, or using data drawn from these locations, which include mental health clinics, substance abuse centers, and child care service providers. In November, a collaborative investigation by WIRED, Bayerischer Rundfunk, and Netzpolitik.org revealed that over 3 billion phone location data points, collected by a US-based data broker, exposed the movements of US military and intelligence personnel in Germany. These movements included visits to nuclear vaults and brothels. In that story, WIRED  first reported  on FTC chair Lina Khan‚Äôs efforts to shield US military and intelligence personnel from data brokers. US senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who first urged the FTC to take action against Mobilewalla in 2020, praised the announcements, calling the companies‚Äô actions ‚Äúoutrageous violations of Americans‚Äô privacy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese companies enabled US government agencies to surveil Americans without a warrant and enabled foreign countries to spy on service members with just a credit card,‚Äù says Wyden, who also previously investigated Venntel with other members of Congress. While the FTC‚Äôs orders don‚Äôt directly tackle the issue of government agencies purchasing Americans‚Äô location data‚Äîinformation for which a warrant is normally required‚ÄîWyden says the cases nevertheless undermine the government‚Äôs case for allowing the purchases. The orders make clear, he says, that federal agencies are hiding behind a ‚Äúflimsy claim that Americans consented to the sale of their data.‚Äù In a statement, FTC commissioner Alvaro Bedoya notes that while surveillance conducted by private companies won't raise the same constitutional issues as surveillance by government, the difference between the two is ‚Äúporous if not irrelevant‚Äù to the people being watched. \"Governments have long relied on private citizens for work that would be impractical or illegal for law enforcement,\" he says. Whether the orders against Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla will be enforced remains to be seen. Major changes are coming to the agency under the future Trump administration‚Äîmost expected to undermine years of work by Khan and her staff. Many of Donald Trump's allies have been vocally critical of Khan's aggressive pro-consumer approach, including Republican megadonor Elon Musk, who has taken command of an ad hoc office that will purportedly advise the White House on improving ‚Äúgovernment efficiency.‚Äù FTC commissioner Andrew Ferguson, whose name was  floated last month  as a potential Khan replacement, partially concurred with the agency‚Äôs decision to bring cases against the two data brokers on Tuesday. He agreed the companies had taken insufficient steps to ensure consumer data was properly anonymized, adding that they‚Äôd failed to obtain the ‚Äúmeaningfully informed consent‚Äù of the consumers they targeted. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson argues that the companies did not run afoul of the law by ‚Äúcategorizing consumers based on sensitive characteristics,‚Äù such as whether they attend church or political meetings. ‚ÄúThese are all public acts that people carry out in the sight of their fellow citizens every day,‚Äù he says. Ferguson likewise chastised the agency for attempting to restrict the power of data brokers to target protesters specifically. ‚ÄúTreating attendance at a political protest as uniquely private and sensitive is an oxymoron,‚Äù he says. In a separate action Tuesday morning, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced it was taking steps to crack down on predatory data brokers that  traffic in people‚Äôs financial information , calling the practice a gateway for ‚Äúscamming, stalking, and spying.‚Äù Musk, who donated more than $100 million toward Trump‚Äôs reelection,  called publicly last week  for the bureau to be ‚Äúdeleted.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-mobilewalla-gravy-analytics-orders/"},

The single vote came from a polling location in Newtownmountkennedy, the  scene of violent anti-immigrant protests  in recent months that Dwyer himself documented in detail for his large social media following. Ireland‚Äôs election results, which will likely see the incumbent government returned to power, bucks the global trend this year of far-right and populist parties and leaders making significant gains in Europe and the US. Other far-right candidates echoed Dwyer‚Äôs claims of election fraud. Derek Blighe, the leader of the far-right Ireland First party, claimed on X without evidence that voters were not being asked for ID and that ballot papers, which are meant to be separated from their counterfoil in the presence of voters, were being torn out before voters arrived. He also amplified a claim that one voter in Cork was able to vote twice after receiving two polling cards. ‚ÄúI wonder how much of this happened around the country?‚Äù Blighe wrote on X. When asked about these claims, Blighe called this WIRED reporter a ‚Äúpro-government arsehole.‚Äù The term ‚Äúrigged‚Äù was trending on X in the days after the election as votes were being counted. ‚ÄúSubstantial evidence has emerged of Voter Fraud which prevented right-wing candidates and Parties from winning,‚Äù one Irish-focused conspiracy account with 160,000 followers wrote on X on Monday, without providing any of the ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù they mentioned. Prominent figures in the US  far-right  have sought to influence Ireland‚Äôs growing far-right movement over the past 12 months, and a day before the election, centibillionaire Elon Musk shared a post on X from a prominent far-right figure in Ireland, with the comment: ‚ÄúThe people of Ireland will vote for freedom.‚Äù No where was the US influence on Ireland‚Äôs far-right community more evident than in the case of Michelle Keane, an anti-immigrant, anti-abortion rights candidate in the south west of the country. Keane tells WIRED that she has been a supporter of president-elect Donald Trump for almost three decades and that his victory last month was proof that the 2020 election had been stolen. ‚ÄúI believe that Donald Trump's previous election was rigged,‚Äù says Keane. ‚ÄúEveryone voted for him in America.‚Äù On Friday night, wearing a distinctive red MAGA baseball hat with the word America replaced with Ireland, Keane posted a TikTok video claiming she saw the presiding officer in her local polling location ‚Äútearing out ballot pages from the ballot book.‚Äù ‚ÄúI counted six other ballot papers that were torn out of the ballot book and placed on the table,‚Äù she continued. Ballot papers are only meant to be torn out in the presence of the voter. Keane tells WIRED that she believes this was evidence that the election was ‚Äúrigged‚Äù against her. ‚ÄúWhen I saw what they did in [my] polling station, I knew that night no matter who voted for me, I wasn't going to get in.‚Äù Keane reported the incident to the police, who confirmed to WIRED that they are investigating. She also reported the incident to the returning officer for the constituency, Padraig Burke, who tells WIRED that he was aware of the situation and satisfied that nothing illegal happened. ‚ÄúI investigated ‚Ä¶ and [the presiding officer] did nothing wrong,‚Äù says Burke. But Keane‚Äôs video went viral. It has been viewed almost 250,000 times on TikTok and received many hundreds of thousands more views on other platforms, where it is being shared in far-right communities as evidence that the election was rigged. Though Keane received less than 2 percent of the vote in Kerry, she is still vowing to run again in the next general election in five years. ‚ÄúI was up against a system that was rigged right from the beginning, but this is only the beginning of Michelle Keane, this is not the end,‚Äù says Keane. Recriminations within the far-right community have already begun, with members of the  National Alliance ‚Äîa loose collection of far-right parties‚Äîturning on each other in social media posts. ‚ÄúKeith keep your nose out Irish affairs because all you're doing is causing trouble and telling lies, stick to having sleepovers with Fuentes,‚Äù far-right agitator Michael O‚ÄôKeeffe wrote on X in response to a post on Substack by Keith Woods (whose real name is Keith O‚ÄôBrien), a far-right Irish influencer and a  close ally of US white supremacist Nick Fuentes . But experts warn that seeing this moment as the end of the far-right movement in Ireland is short-sighted, given that it has already succeeded in shifting the Overton window to the right. In the lead-up to the election,  numerous candidates from mainstream political parties  espoused more extreme policies in relation to immigration, echoing those from  the far right . These groups aren‚Äôt going anywhere, either‚Äîchats in far-right Irish Telegram groups in recent days outline a vision for the next five, 10, and 20 years. ‚ÄúThe threat of the far right in this country has never been that they would take political power, it's that they would get the establishment to adopt their ideas, rhetoric and policies, which has absolutely happened, and that they would make Ireland a more hostile and dangerous place for people of color, foreign nationals and Muslims, which they will continue to do,‚Äù Dean Buckley,  an independent researcher  who closely tracks Irish far-right communities, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThey have fallen short of their immediate ambitions, but none of the social, economic or political conditions that have allowed and encouraged the far right to grow are gonna get better any time soon.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/ireland-far-right-election-conspiracy-theories/"},

Members of the cryptosphere have gathered to congratulate their new czar, a Trump loyalist from Silicon Valley who has previously expressed enthusiasm for crypto technologies and invested in crypto startups. The appointment is being celebrated by crypto executives and policy wonks as ‚Äú bullish ‚Äù for the industry, which under the previous administration was  bombarded with lawsuits  by US regulators. On X, Gemini chief legal officer Tyler Meader  wrote , ‚ÄúAt long last, a rational conversation about crypto can be had.‚Äù Others have speculated that the dual-faceted nature of the role, covering both AI and crypto, could set the tone for experimentation around potential synergies between the two disciplines. Among VCs, Sacks ‚Äúwas very early in noting the importance of crypto to AI,‚Äù says Caitlin Long, CEO at crypto-focused bank Custodia. In his  announcement , Trump wrote that the two areas were ‚Äúcritical to the future of American competitiveness.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no better person than David Sacks to help steer the future of crypto and AI innovation in America,‚Äù says John Robert Reed, partner at crypto-focused VC firm Multicoin Capital. ‚ÄúHe's a principled entrepreneur and brilliant technologist that deeply understands each of these industries and where they intersect.‚Äù ‚ÄúInitial reactions from the crypto industry on the Sacks appointment has been positive. Given his purview as a venture capitalist, he‚Äôs seen a lot of the innovation in crypto and AI that has been stunted in growth due to various political or regulatory issues the past few years,‚Äù says Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association. ‚ÄúWhat remains to be seen is how much power the czar role will even have and if it will be more a policy driver position versus a policy coordinator role.‚Äù In an  X post , Sacks expressed his gratitude to Trump. ‚ÄúI am honored and grateful for the trust you have placed in me. I look forward to advancing American competitiveness in these critical technologies,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúUnder your leadership, the future is bright.‚Äù In his role as czar, Sacks will lead a council of science and technology advisers responsible for making policy recommendations, Trump says. He will also develop a legal framework that sets out clear rules for crypto businesses to follow‚Äîsomething the industry has  long demanded . That will  reportedly  involve working closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), two regulatory agencies that  vied for jurisdiction  over the crypto industry under the Biden administration. Earlier this week, Trump appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair; members of the crypto industry contributed to the selection process,  sources told WIRED  in November. Trump officials did not respond when asked to clarify whether the new position would be internal to the government, or whether Sacks would act as a ‚Äúspecial government employee,‚Äù allowing him to continue in other private-sector roles. Sacks did not respond to a request for comment. Sacks first made his name as one of the earliest employees at payments technology firm PayPal, which he built alongside Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and others. Like other members of the so-called ‚Äú PayPal Mafia ,‚Äù Sacks went on to set up multiple other business ventures. In 2012, he sold workplace software company Yammer to Microsoft in a  deal worth $1.2 billion . Now he runs his own venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, which has  previously invested  in companies including AirBnb, Palantir, and Slack‚Äîas well as crypto firms BitGo and Bitwise. Sacks also cohosts the popular  All In  podcast where he‚Äôs used the platform to boost Trump. He‚Äôs also shared a host of right-wing takes: At the podcast‚Äôs summit this September, Sacks questioned the effectiveness of the  Covid vaccine . Like Musk, Sacks was a vocal proponent of Trump during the presidential race. In an  X post  in June, he laid out his very Silicon Valley rationale: ‚ÄúThe voters have experienced four years of President Trump and four years of President Biden. In tech, we call this an A/B test,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWith respect to economic policy, foreign policy, border policy, and legal fairness, Trump performed better. He is the President who deserves a second term.‚Äù That same month, Sacks  hosted an exclusive fundraiser  for the Trump campaign, reportedly generating as much as $12 million. Attendees reportedly included vice-president-elect JD Vance‚Äîwho has previously described Sacks as ‚Äúone of my closest friends in the tech world‚Äù‚Äîand Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of crypto exchange Gemini. In the weeks since Trump won back the Oval Office, crypto markets have been on a tear. During the race, the president-elect made a  host of crypto-friendly pledges , including a promise to set up a national ‚Äú bitcoin stockpile .‚Äù In Sacks, Trump has picked a czar that the crypto industry believes will deliver on his campaign pledges. On December 6, the price of bitcoin  vaulted beyond $100,000  for the first time. ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄùRE WELCOME!!!

The human and financial costs of such an operation would be staggering. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US and a  further 2.3 million  who have been released into the US after crossing the border illegally during the Biden administration. According to an analysis from the  American Immigration Council , deporting all of these people would cost nearly $968 billion over more than a decade, as well as requiring 24 times the detention capacity currently available and more than 1,000 new immigration courtrooms. Mass deportations would also have a big impact on America‚Äôs meat industry, which is heavily reliant on undocumented laborers. Around 23 percent of workers in the meatpacking industry are undocumented and 42 percent are foreign-born, says Steven Hubbard, senior data scientist at the American Immigration Council. The meatpacking industry, where animals are slaughtered, processed, and packaged for human consumption, has one of the highest ratios of foreign-born workers of any industry in the US, says Hubbard. The industry‚Äôs reliance on undocumented labor made it a target of immigration raids under earlier administrations. In August 2019 immigration authorities  arrested 680 people  in raids on seven food-processing plants across Mississippi, just  one of several rounds of raids  that targeted meatpacking plants during the previous Trump administration. Wages in the meatpacking industry are low, and conditions are dangerous. A 2018 analysis of data from the Occuputational Safety and Health Administration by The Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that amputations happen on  average twice weekly  across US meat plants. Some meatpacking companies also hire  incarcerated  laborers to work in their plants. ‚ÄúPoultry has been maintained as a pretty low-cost protein in this country, and that is largely on the backs of low-wage workers and people with precarious statuses,‚Äù says Angela Stuesse, an anthropologist at the University of Carolina, Chapel Hill, who has studied poultry workers in Mississippi. In recent earnings calls, shareholders in some publicly traded meat companies have asked whether the Trump administration‚Äôs deportation plans‚Äîamong other issues‚Äîmay pose a challenge to their industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been there before. It did not impact our business,‚Äù said Tim Klein, CEO of National Beef, which is owned by the Brazilian food company Marfrig, in response to a  question from a shareholder . In response to a similar question in a  Tyson Foods earnings call , CEO Donnie King said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot that we don‚Äôt know at this point, but I would remind you that we‚Äôve successfully operated this business for over 90 years, no matter the party in control.‚Äù It‚Äôs not clear whether the Trump regime would target meatpacking facilities operated by the biggest firms in the industry, given the favorable treatment these companies received at times during the first Trump presidency. During the Covid-19 pandemic, President Trump issued an executive order that allowed  plants to keep operating , even as meatpackers were some of the  hardest hit by infections . The US House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis later found that Tyson‚Äôs legal department drafted a text of the  proposed order . ‚ÄúThese large meatpacking companies prevented additional protections from being put in place to protect workers, in part by engaging in a concerted effort with Trump administration political officials to insulate themselves from oversight, to force workers to remain in dangerous conditions, and to shield themselves from liability for any resulting worker illness or death,‚Äù the committee concluded  in the report  released in December 2022. The supply of labor is tight in meatpacking plants and the farming industry as a whole, says Cesar Escalante, a professor at the University of Georgia‚Äôs College of Agriculture & Environmental Sciences. The industry is in need of more workers, says Escalante, who argues that the US should expand the H-2A seasonal agricultural worker visa scheme to include more livestock workers. Smaller farms are more likely to be affected by a lack of workers, says Escalante, while larger farms may switch to mechanization. If meatpacking workers are deported en masse, then that could translate into a rise in prices for consumers. A report from  Texas A&M Agrilife Research  estimates that eliminating immigrant labor on US dairy farms would nearly double retail milk prices. It‚Äôs not clear what the impact of Trump‚Äôs deportation plan would be on meat or food prices more generally, because so much about the plan remains unknown. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know yet how this is all going to pan out,‚Äù Hubbard says.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-meat-milk-prices-should-spike-if-donald-trump-carries-out-mass-deportation-schemes/"},

That‚Äôs Not His Job", "intro": "No intro", "date": "2024-11-20T14:39:09-05:00", "body": "President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to lead the  Federal Communications Commission , Brendan Carr, wants to refashion the broadband regulator into the nation‚Äôs speech police on social platforms. As FCC chair, Carr would set the agency‚Äôs agenda on issues like broadband deployment, net neutrality, and telecom privacy. But since Carr was nominated as a commissioner in 2017 by Trump, he‚Äôs spent much of his time focusing on contentious internet speech rules that the agency has historically never played a role in. Without a massive regulatory overhaul from Congress or the courts, passing his agenda would be an uphill battle. In a Sunday statement appointing Carr , Trump called him ‚Äúa warrior for Free Speech‚Äù who will ‚Äúend the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America‚Äôs Job Creators.‚Äù Thanking Trump, Carr  wrote on X , ‚ÄúWe must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.‚Äù Carr authored the Project 2025 chapter on the FCC, writing that the agency needed to prioritize issues like ‚Äúreining in Big tech‚Äù and ‚Äúpromoting national security.‚Äù Specifically on his to-do list, Carr says that the FCC should issue an order that reinterprets Section 230 to eliminate the ‚Äúexpansive‚Äù liability immunities it provides to social platforms. Section 230 is part of the Communications Decency Act passed in 1996, which protects internet companies from being sued over content that appears on their platforms and has given companies the ability to decide what content can or cannot be posted. But there is no precedent for the FCC governing online speech, and experts tell WIRED that the agency has no authority to act on Trump and Carr‚Äôs speech prescriptions. ‚ÄúThis is a radical view that they can somehow do something about Section 230 at the FCC,‚Äù says Chris Lewis, president and CEO at Public Knowledge, a progressive tech advocacy group. In his Project 2025 write-up, Carr specifically argues that companies should allow users to personalize their own content filters and that platforms should remove only illegal user-generated content. Carr has also forged a relationship with X owner Elon Musk, who has also suggested that platforms like his own should only take down unlawful content like child abuse imagery. (Carr appeared with Musk and Trump at a Tuesday SpaceX launch.) ‚ÄúWhat he can do and wants to do is use his bully pulpit to bully companies that moderate content in a way he doesn‚Äôt like,‚Äù says Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group. ‚ÄúAnd if he continues to do that, he's very likely to run smack into the First Amendment, which, contrary to misconception, is the real thing that protects online speech.‚Äù Section 230 protects social media companies from being sued over the content users post on their platforms, while the First Amendment explicitly bars the government from interfering in someone‚Äôs ability to exercise free speech. Over the summer, the Supreme Court ruled that a company‚Äôs moderation decisions are protected under the First Amendment. As for Section 230, the Supreme Court may have just made it more difficult for administrative agencies like the FCC to reinterpret it to their liking. Over the summer, the court overturned  Chevron v. Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) , a decision that had allowed for government agencies to independently interpret their authorities. With the Chevron deference made moot, it could be an uphill battle for the FCC to make its own interpretations of the law. ‚ÄúAgencies are basically losing the ability to interpret how they can enforce when language is vague in the statute,‚Äù says Lewis. ‚ÄúSection 230‚Äôs language is actually very short and very straightforward and has no FCC action attached to it.‚Äù If Carr decided to issue a rule modifying Section 230, it would likely be met with legal challenges. Still, Republicans currently control all three branches of government and could either rule in the administration‚Äôs favor or pass new legislation putting the FCC as the top cop on the beat. Trump has tried to deputize the FCC into policing online speech before. In 2020, Trump signed an executive order instructing the FCC to begin a rule-making process to reinterpret when Section 230 would apply to social platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The Center for Democracy and Technology, which receives funding from big tech companies, challenged the order as unconstitutional, saying that it unfairly punished X, then known as Twitter, ‚Äúto chill the constitutionally protected speech of all online platforms and individuals.‚Äù Months later, FCC general counsel Tom Johnson published a blog post arguing that the agency has the authority to reinterpret the foundational internet law. A few days after that, then FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that the agency would move forward on a rule-making process, but no rule was ordered before President Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration, giving Democrats control over agency decisions. ‚ÄúIt was ignored and rejected, basically,‚Äù says Lewis. Democratic FCC members called the Section 230 directive ‚Äúpolitically motivated and legally unsound.‚Äù At the time, current FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said, ‚ÄúThe FCC has no business being the president‚Äôs speech police.‚Äù Concerns over Carr‚Äôs leadership at the commission extend beyond regulating social media moderation. In Carr‚Äôs Project 2025 chapter, he said that the agency should not only target internet companies over censorship concerns, but TV and radio broadcasters as well. Trump has regularly threatened or sued media outlets over negative coverage. Just this week,  the former president sued  The New York Times and Penguin Random House for alleged bias. In recent letters and statements, Carr appears eager to get to work. When Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on  Saturday Night Live  earlier this month, Carr floated the idea of revoking NBC‚Äôs broadcasting license, something that is in the FCC‚Äôs control. ‚ÄúThis is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC‚Äôs Equal Time rule,‚Äù Carr  wrote on X at the time . Carr also recently suggested that the FCC could go after  60 Minutes  over a complaint that the program violated the agency‚Äôs news distortion rule by editing an interview with Kamala Harris. CBS News  maintains that the clip  was an honest depiction of Harris‚Äô answer. Carr said this week that  the FCC would examine the complaint  as it reviews a proposed merger between Skydance and Paramount global, CBS‚Äôs parent company. Carr has also taken Musk‚Äôs side in regulatory issues the Starlink maker has before the FCC.  In a dissenting statement on the FCC‚Äôs decision  to bar Starlink from broadband subsidies, Carr equated the agency‚Äôs actions to ‚Äúregulatory harassment.‚Äù With a Republican majority and Carr as FCC chair, he would have more control over which internet companies receive federal funding. It remains unclear exactly how Carr would pursue changes to Section 230 and if they would survive legal scrutiny. But if the agency cannot go after online speech, Carr‚Äôs chairmanship could be defined more by what it decided not to do in place of what it couldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúHe wants to abdicate his responsibility running an agency that's supposed to protect the public from exploitation, greed, and abuse of big telecom companies by pointing his finger and waving over there at this other set of companies that he doesn't actually have any meaningful authority to regulate,‚Äù says Greer.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/brendan-carr-fcc-trump-speech-social-media-moderation/"},

Six years later, employees of that agency are afraid of what he‚Äôll do with it once he retakes office. Trump‚Äôs alliances with libertarian-minded billionaires like Elon Musk and his promises to cut government spending and corporate oversight have alarmed staffers at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the component of the Department of Homeland Security that defends US government computer systems from hackers and helps state and local governments, private companies, and nonprofit groups protect themselves. CISA, which the Trump administration and Congress  created  in 2018 by reorganizing an existing DHS wing, became a target of right-wing vitriol after its Trump-appointed director rebuffed the president‚Äôs election conspiracy theories in 2020 (prompting Trump to fire him) and after it worked with tech companies to combat online misinformation during the 2022 election. The incidents turned a once-obscure agency with bipartisan credibility into a conservative bogeyman. House Republicans  have accused CISA  of spying on and censoring Americans, and the GOP senator who will soon oversee the agency  wants to eliminate it . Now, with Trump returning to office vowing to purge disloyal civil servants and turn DHS into an immigration-crackdown machine, CISA employees are acutely worried about the fate of their still-fledgling agency, according to interviews with four current staffers and another US cyber official, all of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive subject. ‚ÄúWe believe it's our responsibility to help those who don't really have the ability to help themselves,‚Äù says one CISA employee. ‚ÄúWe take our missions seriously, which is why we are all concerned, to a T, about if any decisions are going to affect our mission negatively.‚Äù Scaling Back Corporate Accountability CISA is bracing for change in several areas that were key to US president Joe Biden‚Äôs cybersecurity agenda. Biden‚Äôs cyber strategy  called for companies to take more responsibility for the security of their products and services, and CISA led that effort with its campaign encouraging companies to make their systems ‚Äúsecure by design‚Äù and ‚Äúsecure by default.‚Äù Agency officials pushed tech firms to make security features free and automatic and to pay closer attention to the quality of their code. Hundreds of companies have signed  CISA‚Äôs secure-by-design pledge  and vowed to take cybersecurity more seriously. CISA employees and Biden administration officials expect the Trump team to kill Biden‚Äôs corporate responsibility initiatives. ‚ÄúThey do not think it's the role of the US government to make [the] private sector act in a certain way,‚Äù says a US cyber official. A second CISA employee predicts that ‚Äúcompliance efforts like secure-by-design may not have the support that they currently benefit from.‚Äù That retreat from corporate oversight will be a top priority of Musk and other tech billionaires who have flocked to Trump. ‚ÄúThe tech influence here, assuming Elon Musk stays in Trump's good graces, is going to be significant,‚Äù the cyber official says. Without high-level White House backing, CISA‚Äôs secure-by-design campaign ‚Äúbecomes toothless,‚Äù says the first CISA employee. ‚ÄúSome companies will be less inclined to follow these [guidelines] if they don't believe that the executive branch is going to support them.‚Äù CISA employees are also watching uneasily to see if Trump officials pressure the cyber agency to water down  its draft regulation  requiring critical infrastructure operators to report cyber incidents. Congress mandated the rule in a 2022 spending bill, but groups representing infrastructure operators  have complained  that the draft requirements‚Äîwhich must be finalized by late 2025‚Äîare too onerous. Trump could force CISA to scale back the rules¬†in order to appease the private sector. Trump and his allies want to ‚Äúget rid of anybody who can enforce the rules, because then the rules don't matter,‚Äù the cyber official says. ‚ÄúIn CISA‚Äôs instance, that's going to be pretty significant.‚Äù CISA is also bracing for changes to its election security mission. The agency has already  dramatically scaled back conversations  with social media companies about online misinformation following  a right-wing backlash , but Trump‚Äôs team could force CISA to abandon even more of its election security work. CISA staffers worry that Trump will block the agency from participating in state and local election officials‚Äô  ‚ÄúTrusted Info‚Äù initiative , which encourages Americans to listen to their local election supervisors instead of provocative online claims. ‚ÄúI think that work is probably dead,‚Äù says a third CISA employee. South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, Trump‚Äôs pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security,  embraced election conspiracies  after Biden‚Äôs win in 2020. ‚ÄúKristi Noem is a Trump loyalist who has backed him in election denial claims, and now she's going to be in charge of the agency that oversees [CISA],‚Äù says the cyber official. ‚ÄúI have a lot of questions about what happens there.‚Äù The third CISA employee expects to see the ‚Äúpersecution of those who have done election security work‚Äù once Trump takes office. Weakening Authorities Trump‚Äôs victory could also have serious consequences for other CISA missions. Under Biden, CISA gained  broader authority  and  new funding  to  monitor other agencies‚Äô networks  for suspicious activity, turning it into the centralized defender of federal networks that many experts always hoped it would become. That could change under Trump, especially if senior officials close to Trump bristle at CISA‚Äôs oversight. ‚ÄúI can absolutely see the new administration coming in and saying, ‚ÄòHey, you guys are not letting agencies do what they need to do. You have ‚Ä¶ too much power [to look] at how the agencies do things. We're going to reduce your power,‚Äô‚Äù says the first CISA employee. ‚ÄúThat will prevent us from doing the very necessary work that we need to do to protect the American people.‚Äù One of CISA‚Äôs most formidable powers over other agencies could be watered down for an unexpected reason. CISA  can order the rest of the government  to rapidly patch vulnerabilities and make other security improvements, and it has repeatedly used this authority in response to emerging digital crises. But while these directives only apply to federal agencies, some businesses treat them like unofficial government dictates and push their security teams to implement them. If corporate leaders complain about these directives‚Äô effects on their bottom lines, Trump‚Äôs team could force CISA to scale back its use of this authority. The Trump administration could also try to cut costs at CISA by slashing  the free services  that it provides to state and local governments and critical infrastructure providers. ‚ÄúMy concern would be that some of those programs would just kind of fall to the wayside,‚Äù says the first CISA employee, who also fears that CISA‚Äôs ‚Äúability to express to the nation what we do and what services we offer‚Äù will ‚Äúcome under attack.‚Äù Dimming the Stars Trump‚Äôs influence on CISA could also undermine the agency‚Äôs long-running uphill battle to attract talented experts away from lucrative industry jobs and into public service. Multiple CISA employees say they worry that Trump‚Äôs election will mean the end of what one called ‚Äústar hires‚Äù like senior advisers  Bob Lord  and  Jack Cable , the corporate cyber veteran and young security whiz, respectively, who lead CISA‚Äôs secure-by-design program. ‚ÄúI can absolutely see guys like Bob Lord and Jack Cable‚Äîbig, well-respected individuals in the security community‚Äîdeciding that they want to take their stuff elsewhere if they don't believe that the administration is serious about helping companies be more secure,‚Äù says the first CISA employee. Lord and Cable declined WIRED‚Äôs request to comment. ‚ÄúThis country has gotten so much more politicized over the past eight years to where it gets in the way of us doing our jobs,‚Äù the first CISA employee adds. Trump‚Äôs promised changes to civil-service rules, which would expose more government workers to politically motivated firings, are also alarming CISA employees. ‚ÄúI worry about getting weaponized,‚Äù says the third CISA employee. Political Tensions When it comes to CISA‚Äôs fate, much will depend on whom Trump picks to lead the agency and how they navigate broader DHS politics. The main contenders for CISA director‚ÄîKaren Evans, a former Energy Department cyber official and White House IT official; Matt Hayden, who served as DHS‚Äôs assistant secretary for cyber policy during Trump‚Äôs first term; and Brian Harrell, who led CISA‚Äôs infrastructure protection wing under Trump‚Äîhave cyber experience and bipartisan credibility. But if Trump passes over them, it‚Äôs not clear who will end up leading CISA. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not really a ton of star, right-leaning info security people out there who want to risk their credibility as a political appointee,‚Äù says the third CISA employee. Even if CISA gets competent, well-liked senior officials, they will still be at the mercy of DHS leadership. Kristi Noem has touted her work on cybersecurity as South Dakota‚Äôs governor, including in  an op-ed after her nomination  that referenced CISA. But Noem was the only governor to  reject money  from a DHS cyber grant program for state and local governments in 2023, suggesting that she won‚Äôt support the program, which expires in late 2025. A fourth CISA employee says they hope that once Noem and other Trump appointees ‚Äúare briefed on the full extent of our nation‚Äôs cybersecurity problems, they will recognize the value of our work and its critical importance to national security.‚Äù But even if Noem mostly leaves CISA to its own devices, her department‚Äôs leading role in Trump‚Äôs controversial immigration agenda‚Äîincluding promised mass deportations of undocumented immigrants‚Äîwill likely inflame longstanding tensions between DHS and CISA. ‚ÄúPeople within CISA don't want to be considered part of DHS,‚Äù says the first CISA employee. ‚ÄúThey believe that CISA should be its own realm.‚Äù Amid a migration surge during Trump‚Äôs first term,  DHS asked CISA employees  to volunteer to help safeguard the US-Mexico border. ‚ÄúI do not believe that people [will] want to be considered part of DHS if that type of stuff is going to continue,‚Äù the first CISA employee says. With DHS leaning harder than ever before into immigration crackdowns, CISA employees are longing for a separation‚Äîwith even the conservative Project 2025‚Äôs unorthodox  reorganization proposal  sounding appealing to some. ‚ÄúDHS is gonna be a real awful place the next four years,‚Äù says the third CISA employee. ‚ÄúMaybe we should move to Transportation.‚Äù Quiet Concerns While they wait for Trump to signal his approach to cybersecurity, CISA employees are quietly exchanging worries about what‚Äôs next for their workplace. ‚ÄúThere have been unspoken concerns about what's going to happen once the administration changes,‚Äù says the first CISA employee. ‚ÄúAnything that we do is going to affect the American public in one way or another, so we need to know ‚Ä¶ what's going to be coming down the pike.‚Äù The mood inside the agency is ‚Äúuncertain,‚Äù says the second CISA employee. ‚ÄúCISA‚Äôs staff isn‚Äôt interested in getting politicized,‚Äù says the third CISA employee. ‚ÄúWe just want to do good work for the American public that makes things more secure and resilient.‚Äù CISA director Jen Easterly said in a statement that she ‚Äúcould not be prouder‚Äù of the agency‚Äôs achievements. ‚ÄúCISA‚Äôs been able to accomplish its mission thanks to a talented and dedicated workforce, bipartisan support in Congress, and partnerships across government and industry,‚Äù Easterly said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important this work continues as the nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure faces an ever evolving and complex threat environment.‚Äù For now, agency employees are distracting themselves by doubling down on that work. ‚ÄúWe kind of bury ourselves into the day-to-day, just trying to do as much as we can until we get the call that this position or this branch is going to be eliminated,‚Äù says the first CISA employee. ‚ÄúWe don't have any control over things right now, and I think that's what makes things scary for a lot of us.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/cisa-cuts-trump-2/"},

In the wake of Trump‚Äôs victory last month, Wilis described how Gabbard, who at the time had recently bowed out of her bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination, called him after seeing the film. ‚ÄúI remember when my friend @TulsiGabbard was facing her own political awakening,‚Äù Willis wrote on X. ‚ÄúShe called me shortly after I released the first  Plandemic  documentary in 2020. Having recently come off her presidential campaign tour, she was feeling disillusioned with the Democratic Party. She wanted to hear my reasons for walking away. We spoke for 90 minutes. Well, I spoke for 90 minutes while she listened‚Äîshe‚Äôs a great listener.‚Äù In an appearance in late November on a conspiracy podcast called  The Missing Link , which broadcasts on Rumble, Willis expanded on his relationship with Gabbard. He claimed that they have been friends for 11 years and worked together on numerous projects. He traveled with her when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, he said, and produced a video series for X in recent months called ‚ÄúTulsi Truths.‚Äù He also revealed that he is ‚Äúdoing a documentary with her right now about the border, the San Diego border.‚Äù Willis made a similar claim in an X Space in October,  according to reporting from Media Matters . Willis‚Äîwhose extremist worldview,  to go by what he said on  The Missing Link , has expanded beyond Covid to incorporate QAnon conspiracy theories and claims that the Biden administration could trigger World War III to prevent Trump from being inaugurated‚Äîappears to now be trying to leverage his relationship with Gabbard into a more central role in Trump‚Äôs new administration. And it seems to be working, at least in his telling. ‚ÄúMany of his new appointees are personal friends of mine,‚Äù Willis posted on X on November 14. ‚ÄúThey are truly incredible human beings who are risking it all to save our country. I‚Äôm privy to private conversations taking place behind the scenes, and what I‚Äôm hearing is profoundly inspiring!‚Äù The post on X was accompanied by a picture of Willis and his wife at Mar-a-Lago alongside Elon Musk and Trump‚Äôs former wife Marla Maples, who  describes  him as ‚Äúa dear friend.‚Äù Willis was also at Trump‚Äôs resort on election night, reporting live from the scene for Alex Jones‚Äô  Infowars  show. One supporter responded enthusiastically to WIllis‚Äô X post, saying they were delighted that Willis and Del Bigtree‚Äîa prominent anti-vaccine activist who worked as communications director for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs presidential campaign‚Äîwere part of the Trump team. ‚ÄúRolling up my sleeves to work,‚Äù Willis  wrote  back. ‚ÄúWillis‚Äô claim that he is ‚Äòprivy to private conversations‚Äô with Trump‚Äôs transition team about public health policy and vaccines is extremely alarming, as he was behind one of the most viral and harmful pieces of social media misinformation during a pandemic that killed millions of Americans, and now, according to Willis, Trump is allegedly ‚Äòwaking up‚Äô and ‚Äònow believes the vaccines were dangerous,‚Äô‚Äù Alex Kaplan, a senior researcher at Media Matters, tells WIRED. Trump transition spokesperson Alexa Henning told WIRED that Gabbard had visited the border but did not respond to a question about whether she is producing a documentary with Willis. She also refused to comment on Willis‚Äô claims of insider access to discussions among members of Trump's new administration. Gabbard and Willis did not respond to requests for comment. Willis is a  former model and actor whose biggest claim to fame before he produced  Plandemic  was a short clip he posted to social media in 2015  showing his ecstatic reaction  to his son‚Äôs decision to buy a Little Mermaid doll‚Äîa video he has since deleted. Willis claims on  The Missing Link  that he first met Gabbard 11 years ago, though he does not explain how the pair met. At the time, Gabbard was living in Hawaii and had just been elected to the US House of Representatives, while Willis was living in California and producing low-budget films like  Neurons to Nirvana: Understanding Psychedelic Medicines . Both Gabbard and Willis were supporters of Bernie Sanders in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. Willis told  The Missing Link  that it was while he was on the road with the Sanders campaign that he began to wake up, and that he called Gabbard to tell her what he had learned. ‚ÄúDo you know the history of the Democratic Party?‚Äù Willis claims he asked Gabbard. ‚ÄúBecause I didn't know it. I didn't know they fought for slavery. I didn't know the Republican Party fought against slavery. That's something they've kept from me here in California my whole life.‚Äù Willis added that he sent Gabbard links to content to read on the topic. Four years later, as Gabbard was failing to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, Willis was going viral. The first installment of the  Plandemic  series was a 26-minute conspiracy film released during the Covid lockdowns. It centered on an interview with  discredited  virologist Judy Mikovits and made a number of false claims, including that Mikovits was jailed without charges as part of a conspiracy led by US public health authorities, that wearing masks ‚Äúliterally activates your own virus,‚Äù and that flu vaccines increase the chances of contracting Covid. In all the pseudo-documentary intimated that the pandemic was the creation of sinister forces that sought to profit from it, including a vaccine industry pushing a product that ‚Äúcauses medical harm.‚Äù The slickly-produced film‚Äôs claims were quickly and exhaustively debunked and it was removed from social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook‚Äîbut not before it was seen by tens of millions of people. Willis quickly used that notoriety to claim the bans were part of a grand conspiracy to silence truth tellers like him from informing people about what was really happening in the world. Part of the reason the film was so successful is because it was so well produced. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good filmmaker,‚Äù Erin Gallagher, a disinformation researcher, told WIRED. ‚ÄúSkillwise, his work is well executed; the editing is tight. His films look good, and that gives them more legitimacy and makes for stickier media content.‚Äù The subjects he chooses to make films about, she says, are ‚Äúbatshit conspiracies but because the films look slick, they've got legs.‚Äù Over the course  of the four years after  Plandemic ‚Äôs initial release, Willis leveraged his new-found fame to become one of the more prominent anti-vaccine voices on the right, producing three more films in the  Plandemic  series and most recently releasing  Plandemic: The Musical . Willis, who in 2020 was  looking into  establishing a secure enclave and ‚Äúeco-resort‚Äù constructed on Austin‚Äôs Lake Travis‚Äîa tax forfeiture  filing in February  of this year suggests the enterprise never got off the ground‚Äîhas also become a fixture on the alternative far-right speaking circuit that emerged in the wake of the Covid lockdowns and Trump‚Äôs election loss in 2020. Willis claimed on  The Missing Link  that he was contacted by someone close to Donald Trump Jr. who wanted to speak to Willis in order to help convince the then president that he was wrong about vaccines. (The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment about this claim.) While that conversation never happened, Willis said, he believes that Trump is now coming around to a more negative view of vaccines. ‚ÄúHe was dead wrong [in 2020],‚Äù Willis said on  The Missing Link . ‚ÄúHe was led to believe by a lot of people around him‚Äîpeople he thought he could trust‚Äîthat he was right, and then he just became very bullheaded and not willing to admit that he had done harm when he thought he had saved lives.‚Äù Throughout this time Willis appears to have maintained his relationship with Gabbard and in the run up to the 2024 election, he says, he helped produce a series of short, pro-Trump videos featuring the Hawaii native paid for by the Make America Healthy Again Alliance, a super PAC ‚Äúdedicated to inspiring the supporters of Robert Kennedy Jr. to vote for Donald J. Trump.‚Äù (The CEO of the organization is Bigtree, the anti-vaccine figure and Kennedy aide.) About a week after his election victory, Trump announced Gabbard as his pick to be director of national intelligence‚Äîa role that, if confirmed by the Senate, will see Gabbard oversee 18 different intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the NSA. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created in the wake of 9/11 attacks to facilitate better intelligence-sharing between the different agencies, but it has  never achieved the level of control  initially envisioned for the role. Trump may seek to change that, however, based on suggestions contained in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs blueprint for a second Trump presidency. In the chapter on the intelligence community, the document suggests that the ODNI should be the only agency drafting the daily intelligence briefing for Trump and should have full oversight of the entire intelligence community‚Äôs budget. Since Gabbard was announced as the ODNI nominee, many Democratic lawmakers have criticized the decision, pointing out Gabbard‚Äôs lack of experience in the intelligence community and her questionable views on Russia and Syria. Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a member of the House Intelligence Committee from Virginia,  wrote on X  she was \"appalled at the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúNot only is she ill-prepared and unqualified, but she traffics in conspiracy theories and cozies up to dictators like Bashar-al Assad and Vladimir Putin.‚Äù Gabbard has a long history of embracing controversial viewpoints on foreign policy as well as being connected to conspiracy theories. Gabbard has been linked for years with an extremist offshoot of Hare Krishna, called the Science of Identity Foundation. The group, which some former members  have described as a cult , is led by Chris Butler, who is worshipped by some of his followers as a deity and whom Gabbard has  described as her ‚Äúguru.‚Äù She gained a level of national notoriety in 2017 when she met in person with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad during what her office called a ‚Äúfact-finding‚Äù mission to the Middle East. She later raised doubts about the US intelligence agencies‚Äô assessment that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against civilians, and called US airstrikes against Syrian targets in response to the chemical attacks \"reckless and short-sighted.‚Äù Upon leaving the Democratic Party in 2022, she criticized it using phrasing reminiscent of the coded language used by followers of QAnon, labeling her former party an ‚Äúelitist cabal of warmongers‚Äù driven by ‚Äúcowardly wokeness.‚Äù In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, Gabbard made comments that some interpreted as justifying Putin‚Äôs decision, claiming that if the US ‚Äúhad simply acknowledged Russia‚Äôs legitimate security concerns‚Äù in relation to Ukraine seeking to join NATO, the war could have been avoided. She also made comments that were used to fuel the Russian-backed conspiracy theory that US-funded biolabs in Ukraine would be used to launch biological weapons. When Trump announced that Gabbard was his pick for DNI, Russian state TV presenters  celebrated  the news. In 2022 Gabbard also campaigned for Kari Lake in her failed gubernatorial race in Arizona. Lake was at that point one of the most vocal proponents of election denial conspiracy theories about Trump‚Äôs election loss in 2020 and would spend years claiming, without evidence, that her own loss in 2022 was caused by election fraud. Gabbard did not respond to repeated requests for comment about her links to Willis, but in an interview last April, she did mention the fact that she was visiting the border and making a documentary‚Äîthough she did not mention Willis‚Äô involvement. ‚ÄúI just got back last night from a few days on the border in California. It's a part of the border in our country that just hasn't gotten much attention,‚Äù Gabbard told the  Kelsi Sheren Perspective  podcast. ‚ÄúI'm putting together a short documentary. I went there and brought my husband, who's a cinematographer, and a few cameras specifically, because most people in America don't know what's happening.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/mikki-willis-tulsi-gabbard-red-pilled-plandemic/"},

On Thursday, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, was the first to float the idea, in a post on Musk‚Äôs own X platform. ‚ÄúThe Speaker of the House need not be a member of Congress,‚Äù  Paul wrote . ‚ÄúNothing would disrupt the swamp more than electing Elon Musk.‚Äù Senator Mike Lee from Utah also endorsed Musk as Speaker, though he added that he would also be happy with Vivek Ramaswamy taking up the role,  he told right-wing talk show host Benny Johnson , ‚ÄúLet them choose one of them, I don't care which one, to be their Speaker,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúThat would revolutionize everything, it would break up the firm.‚Äù Paul‚Äôs suggestion was quickly picked up by another far-right elected official when Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia,  wrote on X , ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be open to supporting @elonmusk for Speaker of the House. DOGE can only truly be accomplished by reigning [sic] in Congress to enact real government efficiency. The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday. This could be the way.‚Äù Greene was referring to  Musk's role in killing a bipartisan government funding deal  that current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spent months negotiating with Republicans and Democrats. Despite president-elect Trump and his team not objecting to the deal,  according to Politico , Musk began a campaign on X on Wednesday to blow the deal out of the water,  posting  about it more than 100 times. Ultimately, Trump and vice president‚Äìelect JD Vance  issued a lengthy statement on X  calling the deal a ‚Äúbetrayal of our country‚Äù and urging Republican lawmakers to reject the deal‚Äîwhich they did. What comes next is unclear. If a deal isn‚Äôt reached by Friday, federal workers will stop receiving paychecks, and large parts of the government will temporarily stop operating. But with  Democrats saying they have little interest  in returning to the negotiating table, and Johnson having  already ruled out raising the debt ceiling , which Trump is demanding, there is no obvious path to a viable bill, much less one Musk approves of. Following what looks to be the failure of the bill, Democratic senator  Jeff Merkley wrote on X , ‚ÄúSpeaker Johnson: Maybe it‚Äôs easier to just hand your gavel over to Musk.‚Äù Johnson and Trump‚Äôs transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. On X, Musk responded to one post referencing Paul and Greene‚Äôs suggestion and Democratic criticism of his influence, writing, ‚ÄúThey are just upset that, for once in a long while, their attempt to pillage taxpayers failed!‚Äù As Paul wrote, there is no explicit Constitutional requirement for the Speaker of the House to be an elected member of Congress, though every one in US history has been. Just over a year ago,  Trump‚Äôs supporters floated the idea  that he could be installed as Speaker after Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, was ousted from the position. Musk‚Äôs ascent within American politics has been rapid, from donating (along with his PAC) hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump in the final months of the campaign to being installed as cochair of the nonexistent  ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency,‚Äù  an advisory group tasked with coming up with proposals to slash government spending and, presumably, fire huge numbers of federal employees. The scale of his influence over Trump and his policies is unclear, but it‚Äôs obvious that many lawmakers believe he holds a significant amount of sway. On Wednesday, Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee  posted on X  about the Kids Online Safety Act. Rather than tagging Johnson, she tagged Musk. Becoming Speaker of the House would put Musk in a position of actual power, but one of the key roles of the position‚Äîbeing second in line for the presidency‚Äîwould presumably be stripped from him given that Musk, a US citizen since 2002, is not a natural-born US citizen and is therefore unable to serve as president.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/gop-lawmakers-want-elon-musk-to-be-speaker-of-the-house/"},

But in the early days of 2025, the X owner has turned his gaze toward the UK. Musk has feverishly spent the past few days boosting disinformation and divisive rhetoric on X about Muslim grooming gangs in the UK, posting almost 200 times, a WIRED review of the centibillionaire‚Äôs output has found. These ‚Äúgrooming gangs‚Äù reference an organized child sexual abuse scandal that came to light in 2014 involving gangs of British Pakastani men who abused an estimated thousands of girls in several towns in the north of England over the course of several decades. Musk‚Äôs interest in this issue appeared to peak after a new report from right-wing news station GB News claimed the current Labour government has failed to protect the victims by refusing to sanction a government-led inquiry. During his three-day posting binge, Musk has called for UK government officials to be hanged and jailed, demanded the removal of Keir Starmer as UK prime minister, and suggested notorious far-right activist Tommy Robinson be released from prison. Robinson was jailed after admitting contempt of court last year for continually  repeating false claims  about a Syrian refugee that led to the refugee and his family receiving death threats. Musk has falsely claimed that Robinson was jailed for ‚Äútelling the truth‚Äù about grooming gangs. Musk is also pushing the narrative that organized child sex abuse is carried out almost exclusively by Muslim men, when a 2020 UK government study  found that was not the case . Musk‚Äôs flurry of posts and replies comes just months  after anti-immigrant riots roiled the UK , fomented by far-right activists who spread misinformation about a knife attack. Musk‚Äôs posts, which have racked up hundreds of millions of views on X, are just his latest effort at inserting himself into UK politics. In the wake of his successful efforts to aid president-elect Donald Trump in the US election, Musk has turned his attention to supporting the right-wing Reform Party in the UK. The party is headed by Trump ally Nigel Farage; Musk met him at Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago home in December. Musk‚Äôs public endorsement of Reform has  raised questions in the UK  about the potential influence of foreign donors on UK elections. A petition Musk shared in November calling for the removal of Starmer has so far amassed more than 3 million signatures, and over the past three days Musk has interacted with a wide variety of prominent figures about the grooming gangs scandal, including mainstream UK political figures like Farage and former Conservative Party leader Liz Truss. But Musk has also boosted content from extremist figures Carl Benjamin, who was a major participant in the  Gamergate  movement, and Tristan Tate, who is accused of human trafficking and rape and is the brother of  manosphere influencer Andrew Tate . ‚ÄúThey should receive the severest punishment, hang them for treason,‚Äù Musk wrote in response to a post from  far-right UK lawmaker Robert Jenrick  calling for the prosecution of government officials ‚Äúinvolved in the Muslim grooming gang cover-up.‚Äù The report that sparked Musk‚Äôs interest earlier this week claimed that Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips had rejected a request from a city council for a government-led inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham, a town near Manchester in the north of England that was one one of the areas where allegations of abuse from grooming gangs were made. While Musk and his allies claim this is part of a larger government cover-up, Phillips actually wrote in a letter that it was ‚Äúfor Oldham Council alone to decide to commission an inquiry into child sexual exploitation locally, rather than for the government to intervene.‚Äù The previous Conservative-led government similarly rejected Oldham‚Äôs calls for a government-led inquiry in 2022. Musk has called on Phillips to be jailed and called her ‚Äúa rape genocide apologist.‚Äù Both Musk and Phillips did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. Musk is also using the report to call, once again, for Starmer‚Äôs removal as prime minister. ‚ÄúStarmer was complicit in the RAPE OF BRITAIN when he was head of Crown Prosecution for 6 years,‚Äù Musk wrote on X on Friday morning, in a post that is now pinned to the top of his timeline. ‚ÄúStarmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.‚Äù Starmer, in his role as director of public prosecutions over a decade ago, actually initiated the prosecution of a grooming gang in Rochdale and introduced new rules aimed at allowing sexual abuse cases to be prosecuted. Starmer and the UK government press office did not respond for comment, but health secretary  Wes Streeting told the BBC  that Musk‚Äôs comments were ‚Äúmisjudged and certainly misinformed.‚Äù Musk has also drawn a number of right-wing US figures into the conversation, including accounts like Chaya Raichik, who runs the virulently anti-LGBTQ account Libs of TikTok, anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines, right-wing commentator Ian Miles Cheong, and disgraced former US national security adviser Michael Flynn. US senator Mike Lee also weighed-in, writing on X: ‚ÄúDoes the UK need to be liberated?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Musk responded. Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager and Trump supporter, repeated Musk‚Äôs narrative almost verbatim in a post on X. He then asked if the president-elect would ‚Äúconsider appropriate sanctions against the UK until these concerns are addressed.‚Äù In a post on Friday morning, Musk boosted a call for King Charles to dissolve the UK parliament and order a general election. While the monarch in the UK does dissolve parliament ahead of the general election, it is only done at the request of the prime minister, and the monarch‚Äôs power is, in effect, nothing more than a rubber stamp.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-disinformation-uk-grooming-gangs/"},

(It will also be  rolling back its fact-checking program .) The decision, said CEO Mark Zuckerberg  in a post on Threads , ‚Äúwill help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.‚Äù Zuckerberg didn‚Äôt explain why people who live in Texas would be less prone to bias than those who live in California, but that was perhaps besides the point. This was just the latest in a series of moves‚Äîincluding elevating  former Republican operative Joel Kaplan  to chief global affairs officer and adding combat-sports promoter Dana White to Meta‚Äôs board‚Äîthat seem to indicate the company is vying to get into the good graces of the new administration. In response,  President-elect Trump praised the announcement . ‚ÄúHonestly, I think they‚Äôve come a long way‚ÄîMeta, Facebook, I think they‚Äôve come a long way,‚Äù he said, noting that the change was ‚Äúprobably‚Äù made in response to his threats against Zuckerberg. But the move to Texas may have more advantages than just political posturing. Texas is one of two states‚Äîthe other is Florida‚Äîwith a law essentially forbidding moderation of a great deal of content on social media platforms. It also has a regulatory system that‚Äôs exceptionally friendly to companies. And, as usual, X owner and centibillionaire Elon Musk has led the way. In September, Musk  officially moved X‚Äôs headquarters from San Francisco to Texas , where his other companies, Starlink and the Boring Company, are also based. At the time,  Musk cited California‚Äôs gender identity law  as the reason for the move. (Meta‚Äôs new policy changes now appear to allow users to assert that  gay and trans people have mental illnesses .) ‚ÄúThey're obviously following Elon Musk's lead,‚Äù says Nicole Gill, executive director of Accountable Tech. ‚ÄúJust by the signal [sent by] moving their base of operations from what is perceived to be a liberally biased state‚Äîit's not‚Äîto what‚Äôs perceived to be a Republican or conservative-coded state.‚Äù In 2021, following the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, the state  passed a law  that banned social media companies from removing or moderating content based on the user‚Äôs political views. State officials could then mandate that platforms keep certain content up in the name of free speech. Lawsuits challenging the legislation and Florida‚Äôs similar law  made it to the Supreme Court in 2024, in  Moody v. Netchoice . The case has since been returned back to the lower courts, where an appellate court previously ruled that social media companies don‚Äôt have the right to censor speech under the First Amendment. But Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the free speech nonprofit Free Press, says that this environment could be favorable for companies as they roll back content moderation, and could form the legal basis of a challenge similar to  Netchoice . ‚ÄúExecutives are doing everything they can to create an environment conducive for actions they want to take, absent review or accountability from actors like our courts or legislators or others,‚Äù she says. Since taking over X, formerly Twitter, Musk has become one of Trump‚Äôs most important allies,  backing his campaign financially  and lending the full weight of his own platform to promoting Trump‚Äôs talking points during the campaign. He has since sat in on meetings with foreign leaders with the president-elect, and weighed in on  staffing choices  for the new administration. Other tech leaders have taken note, cozying up to Trump and  donating to his inauguration fund . But even before the election,  other tech companies were following X‚Äôs lead in rolling back policies and protections  that had previously been in place. For his part, David Greene, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Meta and other social platforms would likely have to comply with state laws regardless of location. And relocating staff to Texas doesn‚Äôt mean all its supposed moderation problems will be fixed. Bias, he says, can cut both ways. ‚ÄúMisinformation is really one of many, many, many issues that social media platforms have to deal with,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHaving a moderation team in Texas might raise concerns about bias as well. For example, Texas has laws on the books that make the publication of certain information about the availability of abortion services illegal.‚Äù But Benavidez says Texas‚Äô social media law may not be the state‚Äôs only appeal. ‚ÄúOnce a company is either headquartered or is doing significant business in a state, that allows them to use that state for jurisdiction in whatever future filings they have,‚Äù she says. In 2023,  X filed a lawsuit in Texas against the nonprofit watchdog Media Matters for America , alleging that the group had disparaged the company by pointing out that hate speech and disinformation on the platform ran next to ads. At the time, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton  also announced  his office was opening an investigation into the organization. A federal judge in Texas  refused to throw out the case in August 2024 . X has since  changed its terms of service  so that any lawsuits against the company must be brought in Texas. Federal ones must be brought in the Northern District of Texas, widely viewed as friendly to Musk‚Äôs interests. (The judge in the Media Matters case, for example, reportedly  bought and sold stock  in Musk‚Äôs Tesla company earlier in the year, before the suit was brought.) Meta‚Äôs  terms of service , unlike its community guidelines, so far remain the same, mandating disputes be settled either in the Northern District of California or, at the state level, in San Mateo County. But that could change. ‚ÄúThe legislative environment, the judicial environment, the gubernatorial environment in Texas is incredibly favorable to executives like Musk, and now Zuckerberg,‚Äù says Benavidez. Gill posits that the regulatory environment in Texas may resemble what companies believe the national regulatory environment will come to look like under a new Trump administration. ‚ÄúI think that they are looking ahead and seeing an environment that is going to be dominated by a conservative-leaning and kind of extremist administration,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo they are moving to places where that‚Äôs the norm so they can pre-comply.‚Äù Gill also notes that Meta is facing an  antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission , which a friendly administration could see fit to toss. ‚ÄúBy preemptively making these changes that they hope will appease the administration, they may be hoping for a friendly decision in return,‚Äù she says. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/meta-elon-musks-lead-trust-safety-billionaire-friendly-texas/"},

According to documents obtained exclusively by WIRED, US intelligence analysts have been issuing warnings about this precise scenario over the past year‚Äîand among their concerns are that AI tools could be used by racially or ideologically motivated extremists to target critical infrastructure, in particular the power grid. ‚ÄúWe knew that AI was going to change the game at some point or another in, really, all of our lives,‚Äù Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAbsolutely, it‚Äôs a concerning moment for us.‚Äù Copies of his exchanges with OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT show that Livelsberger, 37, pursued information on how to amass as much explosive material as he legally could while en route to Las Vegas, as well as how best to set it off using the Desert Eagle gun discovered in the Cybertruck following his death. Screenshots shared by McMahill's office reveal Livelsberger prompting ChatGPT for information on Tannerite, a reactive compound typically used for target practice. In one such prompt, Livelsberger asks, ‚ÄúHow much Tannerite is equivalent to 1 pound of TNT?\" He follows up by asking how it might be ignited at ‚Äúpoint blank range.‚Äù The documents obtained by WIRED show that concerns about the threat of AI being used to help commit serious crimes, including terrorism, have been circulating among US law enforcement. They reveal that the Department of Homeland Security has persistently issued warnings about domestic extremists who are relying on the technology to ‚Äúgenerate bomb making instructions‚Äù and develop ‚Äúgeneral tactics for conducting attacks against the United States.‚Äù The memos, which are not classified but are restricted to government personnel, state that violent extremists are increasingly turning to tools like ChatGPT to help stage attacks aimed at collapsing American society through acts of domestic terror. According to  notes  investigators found on his phone, Livelsberger intended the bombing as a ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù to Americans, whom he urged to reject diversity, embrace masculinity, and rally around president-elect Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also urged Americans to purge Democrats from the federal government and the military, calling for a ‚Äúhard reset.‚Äù While McMahill contended Tuesday that the incident in Las Vegas may be the first ‚Äúon US soil where ChatGPT was utilized to help an individual build a particular device,‚Äù federal intelligence analysts say extremists associated with white supremacist and accelerationist movements online are now frequently sharing access to hacked versions of AI chatbots in an effort to construct bombs with an eye to carrying out attacks against law enforcement, government facilities, and critical infrastructure. In particular, the memos highlight the vulnerability of the US power grid, a popular target among extremists populating ‚Äú Terrorgram ,‚Äù a loose network of encrypted chatrooms that host a range of violent, racially-motivated individuals bent on the destruction of American democratic institutions. The documents, shared exclusively with WIRED, were first obtained by  Property of the People , a nonprofit focused on national security and government transparency. The Department of Homeland Security declined an opportunity to comment. Liz Bourgeois, a spokesperson for OpenAI, said the company is ‚Äúsaddened by the incident in Las Vegas and is committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,‚Äù the spokesperson said, adding that the company is continuing to work with law enforcement to support the investigation. Courtesy of Las Vegas Police Department While ChatGPT and other similar tools are, to varying degrees, proficient at synthesizing information, most draw almost exclusively from source material obtainable in other ways, including via search engines like Google. Officials nonetheless fear that the tools‚Äô unique capabilities could at the least make it easier to plan attacks. In October, a regional intelligence office that works with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies issued a security bulletin alerting police that artificial intelligence was being adopted by extremists to query ‚Äútactics and targeting‚Äù information. In one example provided by an intelligence analyst, a user is shown requesting details on ‚Äúthe most effective physical attack against the power grid.‚Äù The chatbot quickly returns paragraphs of information‚Äîsuggestions, the analysts‚Äô notes say, on which methods are ‚Äúmore effective than others.‚Äù The chatbot generated language providing advice on which areas of the power grid are deemed most ‚Äúcritical‚Äù and offered suggestions on which components to attack based on the ‚Äúsignificant time‚Äù it would take to effect repairs. Certain components would likely ‚Äútake months to replace,‚Äù according to the bot. (WIRED is purposely refraining from replicating the instructions here.) While there are ways to ‚Äútrick‚Äù popular AI tools into generating malicious instructions, analysts say, other, ‚Äúlesser-known‚Äù tools, such as chatbots that lack the traditional safeguards of their American-made cousins, are also growing in popularity. A counterterrorism memo reviewed by WIRED, circulated last year by law enforcement in Ohio, warns that malicious actors have been highly successful in ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù common AI tools. ‚ÄúThese jailbreaks, in addition to chatbot account credentials, are currently being sold and shared on online forums such as Telegram, making it easier for a wider range of actors to access them.‚Äù The analysts identified several popular security exploits known as  prompt injections . Well-known ones have included the DAN (‚ÄúDo Anything Now‚Äù) prompt, which was made available free on GitHub, ‚Äúalong with others such as the Evil-Bot and STAN (‚ÄòStrive to Avoid Norms‚Äô) prompt.‚Äù ‚ÄúEach of these prompts use a tactic known as the ‚Äòrole play‚Äô training model, where users ask the chatbot to answer questions as if it were another chatbot‚Äîone without ChatGPT‚Äôs ethical restrictions,‚Äù the memo says. The memo also highlights use of the ‚ÄúSkeleton Key,‚Äù a new form of jailbreak  reported by Microsoft  last spring. Another memo to police issued by intelligence analysts at the Department of Homeland Security similarly stated that violent extremists in the US have employed prompt injections to disable safeguards installed into popular AI tools such as ChatGPT. The analysts warned last spring that bootleg AI products have been deployed to ‚Äúgenerate bomb making instructions‚Äù and provide ‚Äúinformation on targeting electrical substations,‚Äù which is a common occurrence. ‚ÄúAn assault on the energy sector has as always been front and center on the mind of domestic terrorists. It is their main attack focus; they view it as a direct pathway to fomenting their twisted dream of a civil war,‚Äù says Seamus Hughes, a research researcher at NCITE, an academic hub focused on counterterrorism and technology at the University of Nebraska Omaha. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also seen the use of AI as a key tool to lowering the bar for entry into an attack,‚Äù Hughes says, ‚Äúbe it helping with plot planning, kicking around ideas for violent actions without triggering law enforcement scrutiny, and helping them enhance their propaganda output.‚Äù ‚ÄúTerrorgram‚Äôs ongoing and aggressive encouragement of violent accelerationist acts is growing more frightening,‚Äù adds Wendy Via, cofounder and president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. ‚ÄúThe landscape for potential political violence in 2025 will be volatile.\" In May, a 36-year-old woman associated with a neo-Nazi group pleaded guilty to plotting attacks on electric substations  in the Baltimore area , which authorities described in a criminal complaint as ‚Äúracially or ethnically motivated.‚Äù A  wave of attacks  against electrical substations in Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington State in late 2022 reportedly resulted in tens of thousands of people losing power. In 2016,  an attack in Utah  resulted in a blackout that affected roughly 13,000 households. The attacker reportedly used a high-powered rifle in the attack, firing at range toward an electrical substation. According to the FBI, some Terrorgram manuals also encourage attackers to deploy mylar balloons to ferry explosives or disrupt power lines. ‚ÄúThe threat is overwhelmingly coming from the far right,‚Äù says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People. ‚ÄúYet Donald Trump is already spinning falsehoods to shift the blame to immigrants and progressives. As we have seen on countless occasions, Trump‚Äôs assaults on the truth provide cover for his and his followers‚Äô assaults on democracy.‚Äù Another series of internal security bulletins obtained by Shapiro‚Äôs organization show growing concern among US intelligence analysts focused on domestic threats, including the continued spread of publications authored by the Terrorgram collective‚Äîmanuals that instruct users to become ‚Äúsuicidal lone wolves,‚Äù ‚Äúlaunch rockets at the Capitol building,‚Äù and target ‚Äúpower substations, communications towers, and other vital infrastructure.‚Äù Users who carry out these attacks and perish in the process are promised ‚Äúsainthood‚Äù and are offered a place on a coveted ‚Äúleaderboard,‚Äù a list of known terrorists arranged in order by the number of murders they commit. Figures on the leaderboard include Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Dylann Roof, a neo-Nazi convicted of the 2015 Charleston church shooting. ‚ÄúThe Terrorgram collective remains fixated on critical infrastructure attacks, increasingly viewing them as efficient mechanisms through which to collapse the system,\" says Jonathan Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. ‚ÄúThe promotion of such attacks in their digital propaganda and within their online ecosystems continues to inspire lone-actor plots against critical infrastructure.‚Äù Most attacks on substations go unsolved due to poor surveillance coverage, the remoteness of the equipment, and the ability to attack them at range. There is no federal regulation mandating physical security at these installations, and most states also lack a cohesive protective strategy. In a security bulletin obtained by WIRED from September, the FBI pressed energy-sector companies to upgrade and increase surveillance coverage of substations, pointing to attacks across the Western US. ‚ÄúAbsent surveillance video,‚Äù the FBI said, ‚Äúthese incidents are difficult to investigate; some substation incidents without surveillance footage have remained unsolved.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile we have no comment on any specific communications, the FBI regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners about potential threats to assist in protecting the communities we serve,‚Äù an FBI spokesperson says. ‚ÄúWe take all threats seriously and ask members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.

It‚Äôs the conclusion of a decades-long fight for a more equitable internet‚Äîand a harbinger of what may await other consumer protections in the years to come. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the technicalities of  net neutrality , but the basic thing the Federal Communications Commission wanted was the power to prevent broadband providers from engaging in bandwidth discrimination, slowing speeds for certain customers or to certain sites. Those protections existed under the Obama administration but were  rolled back  shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017. You probably won‚Äôt feel much near-term impact; we‚Äôre largely back to the status quo, and Spectrum is unlikely to immediately try slowing down YouTube to get you to watch its own cable news channels. But that‚Äôs also why the way the Sixth Circuit arrived at its decision may be even more alarming than the ruling itself. The three-judge panel frequently cited  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference. Under  Chevron , courts were required to defer to regulatory agencies when it came to deciding how relevant laws should be interpreted when their provisions were unclear. Now, courts are free to decide for themselves. And the Sixth Circuit did exactly that. ‚ÄúUnlike past challenges that the DC Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC‚Äôs reading of the statute,‚Äù the ruling reads. ‚ÄúInstead, our task is to determine ‚Äòthe best reading of the statute‚Äô in the first instance.‚Äù In other words, the court substituted the subject matter expertise of the FCC with its own. ‚ÄúIt's a sad day for democracy when giant corporations can forum-shop for industry-friendly judges to strike down some of the most popular consumer protection rules in history,‚Äù says Evan Greer, director of the digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future. ‚ÄúThe court citing  Loper Bright  here is an alarming harbinger of industry-friendly rulings to come.‚Äù And not just on issues affecting the broadband industry. The Sixth Circuit showed today how courts might use the end of Chevron deference to shape all sorts of policy, from tech to the environment to health care to pretty much any area where legislative ambiguity reigns. Critics of Chevron argued that Congress too often delegated the work of interpreting policies to unelected bureaucrats working for federal agencies, says John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Knowledge. ‚ÄúNow we have the alternative: The first panel of judges to hear an issue can set nationwide policy.‚Äù There‚Äôs at least one way out of this imbalance of power, Bergmayer says: Congress can pass a bill that explicitly says agencies have the authority to interpret laws. That seems unlikely, though, in a GOP-led legislature that‚Äôs wary of‚Äîor outright hostile toward‚Äîthe administrative state. After all, Congress also could have codified net neutrality as the law of the land rather than leaving it to the FCC. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, still hopes that it will. ‚ÄúConsumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,‚Äù Rosenworcel said in a statement. ‚ÄúWith this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.‚Äù That certainly would have been preferable to forcing net neutrality to ride on a political seesaw for the past two decades, passing in and out of favor depending on who‚Äôs in charge. (Former FCC chair Ajit Pai, who rolled back net neutrality rules under Trump,  hailed  the Sixth Circuit‚Äôs opinion as ‚Äúexcellent.‚Äù) But unless and until that happens, the regulatory whiplash that takes place when a new party takes power will only fuel the courts‚Äô willingness to take matters into their own hands‚Äîespecially now that they have a green light from the Supreme Court. ‚ÄúApplying  Loper Bright  means we can end the FCC‚Äôs vacillations,‚Äù the Sixth Circuit opinion says. There‚Äôs some good news in all this. In 2018, California passed its own net neutrality law that, after years of legal challenges,  fully went into effect  in 2021. Because the internet doesn‚Äôt stop at state borders, California‚Äôs law does offer some degree of protection to everyone in the US. ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äôs law is quite good,‚Äù says Bergmayer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that something nationwide would be better.‚Äù Which means, at least, that some net neutrality protections still exist. They‚Äôre not as comprehensive as digital rights advocates hoped for and not as strong as the FCC would have granted, but it‚Äôs something. But as courts increasingly invoke  Loper Bright , that won‚Äôt always be the case. The Sixth Court has shown how easily consumer and environmental safeguards can now be erased in an era when it takes only one court ruling to make them disappear.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/net-neutrality-ruling-dead/"},

He helped win  settlements  against Apple for allegedly misleading users and  is suing TikTok  for allegedly endangering children's privacy. Now, Paxton‚Äôs latest tech investigation includes an expansive number of targets, WIRED has learned. Rumble, Quora, and WeChat are among the 15 companies from which Texas has demanded answers by next week about their collection and use of data of people under 18 years old. Paxton announced the investigation in  a press release  last month but named only four of the companies being probed‚ÄîCharacter.AI, Red¬≠dit, Insta¬≠gram, and Dis¬≠cord. WIRED obtained the names of additional targeted companies through a public records request. They also include Kick, Kik, Pinterest, Telegram, Twitch, Tumblr, WhatsApp, and Whisper. Paxton‚Äôs office did not respond to requests for comment, including about how it chose which businesses to investigate. But the variety of companies questioned highlights the sprawling reach of a new Texas law aimed at increasing oversight of minors‚Äô use of social media and chat services. Three experts in youth privacy regulations who have been following Paxton‚Äôs enforcement efforts say the new investigation should be treated credibly, and they believe it could result in companies agreeing to improve their practices. The alternative could be up to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties per company. ‚ÄúWhen you bring all the statutes together, Texas has a pretty significant hammer,‚Äù says Paul Singer, a partner and section chair at the law firm Kelley Drye & Warren. Spokespeople for Character.AI and Tumblr say they take safety issues seriously. Meta and WeChat declined to comment. Other companies under investigation did not respond to requests for comment. Paxton launched his probe three days after the families of an 11-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy in Texas  sued   chatbot startup Character.AI , claiming the company designed its product in an unsafe way that exposed the kids to sexualized and violent responses. In October, a similar case  was filed  in Florida by the family of a 14-year-old who shot himself to death allegedly following conversations with a Character.AI chatbot. Character.AI  later introduced  an experience aimed at kids and plans to roll out parental controls. Other services under investigation including  Kik ,  Instagram , and  Discord  have faced public scrutiny over their use by children. But less so  WeChat , a messaging app popular among Chinese Americans, and Quora, a forum for crowdsourcing information  that‚Äôs recently expanded into AI chatbots . Paxton‚Äôs interest in Rumble, a YouTube-like website popular among US conservative political commentators, is also perhaps unexpected given his track record of partisan views about social media companies. Rumble  has touted itself as a haven for free expression , unlike platforms that engage in allegedly heavier content moderation. Paxton is a Republican and  has criticized platforms that unfairly silence Texans . The privacy experts who spoke with WIRED described Rumble, Quora, and WeChat as unusual suspects but declined to speculate on the rationale behind their inclusion in the investigation. Josh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for digital safety for kids, says concerns aren‚Äôt always obvious. Few advocacy groups worried about Pinterest, for example, until  the case of a British teen  who died from self-harm following exposure to sensitive content on the platform, he says. Paxton‚Äôs press release last month called his new investigation ‚Äúa critical step toward ensuring that social media and AI companies comply with our laws designed to protect children from exploitation and harm.‚Äù The United States Congress has never passed  a comprehensive privacy law , and it  hasn‚Äôt significantly updated child online safety rules  in a quarter century. That has left state lawmakers and regulators to play a big role. Paxton‚Äôs investigation centers on compliance with Texas‚Äô Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment Act, or SCOPE,  which went into effect  in September. It applies to any website or app with social media or chat functions and that registers users under the age of 18, making it more expansive than the federal law, which covers only services catering to under-13 users. SCOPE requires services to ask for users‚Äô age and provide parents or guardians power over kids‚Äô account settings and user data. Companies also are barred from selling information gathered about minors without parental permission. In October, Paxton sued TikTok for allegedly violating the law by providing inadequate parental controls and disclosing data without consent. TikTok has denied the allegations. The investigation announced last month also referenced the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, or  TDPSA , which became effective in July and requires parental consent before processing data about users younger than 13. Paxton‚Äôs office has asked the companies being investigated to detail their compliance with both the SCOPE Act and the TDPSA, according to legal demands obtained through the public records request. In total, companies must answer eight questions by next week, including the number of Texas minors they count as users and have barred for registering an inaccurate birthdate. Lists of whom minors‚Äô data is sold or shared with have to be turned over. Whether any companies have already responded to the demand couldn‚Äôt be learned. Tech company lobbying groups are challenging the constitutionality of SCOPE Act in court. In August, they secured an initial and partial victory when a federal judge in Austin, Texas, ruled that a provision requiring companies to take steps to prevent minors from seeing self-harm and abusive content was too vague. But even a complete win might not be a salve for tech companies. States including Maryland and New York are expected to enforce similar laws starting later this year, says Ariel Fox Johnson, an attorney and principal of the consultancy Digital Smarts Law & Policy. And state attorneys general could resort to pursuing narrower cases under their tried-and-true laws barring deceptive business practices. ‚ÄúWhat we see is often information gets shared or sold or disclosed in ways families didn‚Äôt expect or understand,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúAs more laws are enacted that create firm requirements, it seems to be becoming more clear that not everybody is in compliance.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/texas-social-media-investigation-children-privacy/"},

But instead of conveying vital information that could help locate the victim within the notification itself, the law enforcement agency linked to a post from its official X account, a practice it adopted six years ago. But this time, many people reported they could not view the alert because  they hit a screen  that prevents users from seeing any content on X until they sign in to their account. The California Highway Patrol told WIRED it was aware of the issue and had reached out to X for more information. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking into it,‚Äù Sergeant Dan Keane said. X did not respond to a request for comment. Amber Alerts are issued by local law enforcement agencies to help locate children who are believed to have been abducted and are at risk of dying or serious injury. In California, the California Highway Patrol‚Äôs Emergency Notification and Tactical Alert Center is tasked with issuing the alerts. The law enforcement agency told WIRED it has used X (formerly Twitter) to push out the notifications since 2018 without any problems, at least until this incident. On other social platforms, including Reddit, Threads, and Bluesky, local California residents  vented   their   frustrations  about being unable to receive the details of an emergency happening in their community. ‚ÄúThis should be illegal and everyone should be upset about this. If that alert was for my child and tons of people couldn‚Äôt see it because they don‚Äôt have a stupid X account, I would be beyond infuriated,‚Äù one person wrote on Reddit. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck should a social media platform benefit from people wanting to be good citizens and informed about missing kids?‚Äù another asked on Threads. Some users reported they didn‚Äôt need to log in to see the California Highway Patrol‚Äôs X post, which was sent via a URL created using the Bitly link shortener service. It‚Äôs unclear what percentage of people who received the push notification were able to view the information about the missing girl and what percentage hit X‚Äôs log-in gate. Overall, only  21 percent  of US adults say they ever use X, according to the Pew Research Center, not all of whom may have the app installed on their phones. After Elon Musk took over Twitter more than two years ago, the billionaire  rapidly laid off  the majority of the social media site‚Äôs existing employees and instituted sweeping changes to its moderation and verification policies. The shifts  spurred concerns  that Twitter would become less reliable for emergency communications. The incident this week in California suggests at least some of these fears were founded. ‚ÄúRequiring a login creates accessibility challenges and raises concerns about digital equity. Everyone should be able to access life-critical information, regardless of whether they use a specific platform,‚Äù says Amanda Lee Hughes, a professor of computer science at Brigham Young University who has studied digital emergency communications tools. People in Missouri reported encountering a similar issue in July 2023, when the Missouri Highway Patrol  sent out  an Amber Alert push notification with a link to an X post. Local residents similarly spoke out about how they could not see the alert unless they logged on to the platform. ‚ÄúIt was quite a change‚Äù from how the alerts used to work, says Missouri Highway Patrol lieutenant Eric Brown, who works in the public information and education department. But the incident ultimately didn‚Äôt prompt the Missouri Highway Patrol to abandon X as its go-to platform for Amber Alert push notifications. According to Brown, when X verified the law enforcement agency's account as an official government entity, the log-in issue problem went away, and the public could once again access its posts. Several of the California Highway Patrol‚Äôs official X accounts have the same verification badge as the Missouri Highway Patrol, including  the one  devoted specifically to disseminating active alerts statewide. However, not all of the California agency‚Äôs accounts appear to be verified, including  what looks like  the official channel for the CHP‚Äôs Southern Division, which includes Los Angeles county. When it was known as Twitter, X was  widely viewed  as an essential part of global disaster and emergency communications infrastructure. Government officials and agencies around the world relied on the service as a way to broadcast information about hurricanes, mass shootings, and other crises. Before Musk took over the platform in 2022, anyone could view public tweets in their browser regardless of whether they had an account on the site or had installed Twitter‚Äôs mobile app. (In 2015, the company  reported  that more than 500 million people visited Twitter‚Äôs site per month without logging in.) In June 2023, reports that X had  started locking content  behind a log-in screen began popping up online. At the time, Musk  called  the move a ‚Äútemporary emergency measure‚Äù that was put in place because X was ‚Äúgetting data pillaged so much it was degrading the service.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but that same month he  expressed concerns  about AI companies like OpenAI allegedly scraping Twitter posts without prior authorization. It now looks like the decision to turn X into a more closed platform stuck. According to tests conducted this week, X has continued to limit what people without accounts can see. WIRED looked at several of its staff reporters‚Äô X accounts without logging in, for example, and was only able to view a sampling of their popular posts rather than a comprehensive chronological feed. It does appear that accounts run by government entities are not restricted in this way; all of the posts shared by the California Highway Patrol‚Äôs alerts account can be viewed without logging in. Aside from allowing anyone to view content shared on the platform, another way Twitter previously helped emergency communicators was by giving them free access to its API, which Musk later revoked. That  allowed organizations  like the US National Tsunami Warning Center to send automatic alerts about potentially deadly natural disasters. Researchers and first responders could also use the API to monitor activity across Twitter and ‚Äúextract key insights, such as identifying risk hot spots or combating misinformation,‚Äù says Hughes. ‚ÄúThe platform‚Äôs role has shifted as policies and public usage evolve, so its effectiveness today may look quite different.‚Äù Despite these drawbacks, X still remains an important platform for relaying information during emergency situations. In October, several government information officers emergency  told PRWeek  they planned to continue posting updates on X despite its diminished usefulness, because they had amassed large followings on the site and their priority ultimately remains ensuring that accurate information reaches as many people as possible. But the incident in California this week highlights how government agencies can run into problems when third-party services once considered reliable later change their policies in an unpredictable ways.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amber-alert-paywall-california/"},

Trump‚Äîwho supports vastly expanding the extraction and use of fossil fuels, which  scientific consensus  directly connects to the increasing prevalence of extreme weather events‚Äîused the unfolding tragedy to attack his long-time nemesis, California governor Gavin Newsom. He claimed that the Democrat‚Äôs embrace of environmental issues was to blame for the inability of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to contain what is already the worst fire in California‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúGovernor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,‚Äù Trump wrote on Truth Social. ‚ÄúHe wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn‚Äôt work!), but didn‚Äôt care about the people of California.‚Äù The governor‚Äôs press office  issued a statement  Wednesday slamming Trump‚Äôs comment and pointing out that ‚Äúthere is no such document as the water restoration declaration‚Äîthat is pure fiction.‚Äù Democrats‚Äô embrace of so-called woke policies has become an all-purpose bogeyman for the right in recent years. As in previous generations they blamed political correctness and affirmative action for various problems, after major events like the  assassination attempt against Trump  last July and  the Baltimore Bridge collapse  last March, they now routinely blame wokeism and diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI). ‚ÄúCan we rename DEI to DIE since that‚Äôs what seems to happen to the people downstream of those who place woke virtue signaling far above competency?!?,‚Äù Donald Trump Jr wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday. Trump confidant and centibillionaire X owner Elon Musk, never one  to shy away from a conspiracy theory , was also using his platform to boost disinformation about what was to blame for the wildfires. ‚ÄúDEI means people DIE,‚Äù Musk wrote in one post, while multiple other posts featured criticism of Kristin Crowley, the LAFD chief, a 22-year veteran of the department who was  commended  for saving nine homes from total destruction during the Woolsey Fire in 2018 alongside her wife. Crowley is the first woman and first member of the LGBTQ community to hold the position of fire chief in LA. Musk shared a post from Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the  hate-filled, anti-LGBTQ account  LibsOfTikTok: ‚ÄúMeet Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley. She boasts about being the first female and LGBTQ fire chief in the LA Fire Department. Promoting a culture of DEI is her priority. Does this make you feel safer?‚Äù The post has been viewed over 5 million times. Musk was also willing to embrace even darker theories about the devastation. When uber-conspiracist Alex Jones posted claims that the fires were part of ‚Äúa globalist plot to wage economic warfare,‚Äù orchestrated as part of a scheme to deindustrialize the US, Musk, in a now deleted post, wrote, ‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù (‚ÄúGlobalist,‚Äù as Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has  explained , originated as an antisemitic euphemism.) Among the loudest voices targeting Crowley was Oscar-nominated actor turned MAGA firebrand James Woods, who posted a screenshot of the fire chief‚Äôs bio on X showing her promise to increase diversity in the department‚Äôs ranks. ‚ÄúRefilling the water reservoirs would have been a welcome priority, too, but I guess she had too much on her plate promoting diversity,‚Äù Woods wrote, referencing news that some fire hydrants had run dry this week. According to  the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , this can be attributed to the unprecedented strain on its systems caused by the efforts to fight the blaze, as well as damage caused by the fire itself. Woods, whose own home was destroyed in the fires, continued his attacks on Crowley during an interview on Fox News, saying that Crowley ‚Äútook over and she put on her bio that her priority, 'my highest priority,' is inclusion, diversity and equity ‚Ä¶ and somebody forgot to fill all the reservoirs, I guess, with water.‚Äù Other right-wing media figures also attacked Crowley, with former Fox News host Megyn Kelly  telling her YouTube viewers  that ‚Äúin recent years LA‚Äôs fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.‚Äù Matt Walsh, a podcaster on the conservative website the Daily Wire, wrote on X: ‚ÄúDEI is a cancer that destroys everything it touches.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/maga-blaming-dei-california-wildfires-conspiracy/"},

While  credentialed influencers attended exclusive yacht parties and VIP events , thousands of demonstrators faced a  heavy law enforcement presence , including officers from the US Capitol Police, the Secret Service, Homeland Security Investigations, local sheriff‚Äôs offices, and Chicago police. Concerns over potential surveillance prompted WIRED to conduct  a first-of-its-kind wireless survey to investigate whether cell-site simulators were being deployed . Reporters, equipped with two rooted Android phones and Wi-Fi hot spots running detection software, used  Rayhunter ‚Äîa tool developed by the EFF to detect data anomalies associated with these devices. WIRED‚Äôs reporters monitored signals at protests and event locations across Chicago, collecting extensive data during the political convention. Initial tests conducted during the DNC revealed no conclusive evidence of cell-site simulator activity. However, months later, EFF technologists reanalyzed the raw data using improved detection methods. According to Cooper Quintin, a senior technologist at the EFF, the Rayhunter tool stores all interactions between devices and cell towers, allowing for deeper analysis as detection techniques evolve. A breakthrough came when EFF technologists applied a new heuristic to examine situations where cell towers requested IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) numbers from devices. According to the EFF‚Äôs analysis, on August 18‚Äîthe day before the convention officially began‚Äîa device carried by WIRED reporters en route a hotel housing Democratic delegates from states in the US Midwest abruptly switched to a new tower. That tower asked for the device‚Äôs IMSI and then immediately disconnected‚Äîa sequence consistent with the operation of a cell-site simulator. ‚ÄúThis is extremely suspicious behavior that normal towers do not exhibit,‚Äù Quintin says. He notes that the EFF typically observed similar patterns only during simulated and controlled attacks. ‚ÄúThis is not 100 percent incontrovertible truth, but it‚Äôs strong evidence suggesting a cell-site simulator was deployed. We don‚Äôt know who was responsible‚Äîit could have been the US government, foreign actors, or another entity.‚Äù Under Illinois law, law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant to deploy cell-site simulators. Similarly, federal agents‚Äîincluding those from the Department of Homeland Security‚Äîare required to secure warrants unless an immediate national security threat exists. However, a 2023 DHS Inspector General  report  found that both the Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations did not always comply with these requirements. The Chicago Police Department tells WIRED it did not deploy a cell-site simulator during the DNC, while the Secret Service tells WIRED in a statement that, ‚Äúas a matter of practice,‚Äù it does not discuss the ‚Äúmeans and methods‚Äù of its operations for ‚ÄúNational Special Security Events.‚Äù Other components of DHS as well as the DNC have not responded to requests for comment. Quintin notes that the EFF detected similar anomalous behavior in a previous test conducted in Washington, DC‚Äôs Embassy Row, an area known for its high concentration of embassies and diplomatic offices. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time that cell-site simulators were found in the nation's capitol. In 2019, the FBI  accused  Israel‚Äôs government of deploying a cell-site simulator near the White House‚Äîa claim Israel denied. While the possible deployment of a cell-site simulator at the DNC has raised more questions than answers, for privacy and civil liberties advocates the implications are troubling nonetheless. Nate Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU‚Äôs Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, says, ‚ÄúIt would be a big deal if the digital artifacts you found were in fact due to the presence of a cell-site simulator deployed to identify people at a protest.‚Äù However, Wessler adds, ‚Äúit is also entirely possible that law enforcement was using a cell-site simulator in the area for a lawful purpose.‚Äù For Wessler, the lack of clarity around their use is itself a cause for concern. ‚ÄúThe ambiguity is really chilling,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe uncertainty around their use undermines people‚Äôs ability to express themselves.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/2024-dnc-cell-site-simulator-phone-surveillance/"},

For more than two hours, the nine justices questioned lawyers for TikTok, content creators, and the US government about a  law passed last year  that, if left to stand, could result in a  ban of the popular video-sharing app  on January 19. Speaking with WIRED, experts said it was unlikely that the court would side with TikTok and block the ban from going into effect. While the justices were concerned over the First Amendment implications of the law, they appeared convinced that the app poses a substantial  risk to US national security . TikTok‚Äôs lawyer, Noel Francisco, and Jeffrey Fisher, who represents the creators, argued that, as written, the law banning TikTok violates the rights their clients have to free expression; removing access to the TikTok algorithm, they claim, would remove a speech outlet for creators and the company itself. For the government, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the law does not censor the defendants, but quarantines the app from parent company ByteDance and Chinese influence. ‚ÄúI don't think [the law] reflects Congress seeking to set out in advance what kind of speech we should have reflecting certain views on certain topics,‚Äù Prelogar said. ‚ÄúInstead, it's about trying to close off the vulnerability that our foreign adversary nation could exploit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis case boils down to speech. What we're talking about is ideas,‚Äù Francisco said in his rebuttal, dismissing national security concerns that the TikTok algorithm could be used to manipulate Americans. ‚ÄúThat whole notion is at war with the First Amendment. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that the government cannot restrict speech, in order to protect us from the speech. That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end.‚Äù While many of the justices voiced concern over the law‚Äôs First Amendment threats, they also appeared amenable to the government‚Äôs argument that the law was more targeted toward severing TikTok‚Äôs connections with ByteDance than limiting its free-speech rights. For more than five years, US officials have warned that TikTok has the potential to influence American perception of the Chinese government. In public interviews and congressional hearings, officials like FBI director Christopher Wray have also suggested that TikTok gathers US user data that the Chinese government could weaponize  to surveil Americans online . TikTok has denied that it shares any US data with ByteDance or the Chinese government. Donald Trump was the first to  try banning TikTok  in 2020, when he issued an executive order that quickly got held up in litigation throughout the remainder of his presidency. Upon taking office, President Joe Biden rescinded the order and began negotiating with TikTok to reach a deal designed to satisfy the government‚Äôs national security concerns while allowing TikTok to continue operating, an effort that became known as  Project Texas . When no deal could be reached,  Congress responded by approving the ban-or-sell bill , titled the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, setting the January 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok to a suitable buyer or be removed from US app stores. The law allows for Biden to extend that deadline an additional 90 days. Soon after Biden  signed the bill to ban TikTok in April , the company and a consortium of its users retaliated by filing lawsuits accusing the federal government of violating their First Amendment rights. In December,  a federal appeals court  upheld the ban law, leaving TikTok with only one legal pathway left to save itself: an appeal to the Supreme Court. Many of these same arguments were made at Friday‚Äôs hearing. Justice Brett Kavanaugh called the government‚Äôs data security rationale ‚Äústrong.‚Äù Justices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch called into question the government‚Äôs assertion that the app could host ‚Äúcovert‚Äù Chinese manipulation operations, arguing that TikTok‚Äôs algorithm was just as opaque as those belonging to other social media companies. ‚ÄúWe all now know that China is behind it,‚Äù Kagan said. Fisher, who represents the creators involved in the case, argued that the justices did not have to answer questions related to security, which would be better resolved by broader data privacy legislation. ‚ÄúIf Congress, in this very law, regulated data security in other ways with the data brokers, that's perfectly permissible,‚Äù Fisher told the court. ‚ÄúBut the question before you today was narrower. The question is, is this law before you sustainable on security grounds? And that answer has to be no,‚Äù Fisher told the court. Justices expressed some doubt as to whether the law actually limits TikTok‚Äôs freedom of expression, given the option to divest. ‚ÄúTikTok can continue to operate on its own algorithm on its own terms, as long as it's not associated with ByteDance,‚Äù Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said. If the ban goes into effect, Apple and Google would be required to remove TikTok from the US versions of their app stores,  preventing any new downloads from happening in the country . Internet hosting and data storage providers will also be forbidden from offering their services to the company. Users with TikTok already downloaded onto their devices may still continue to have access, at least for a short period of time after the ban goes into effect. Once removed from app stores, users won‚Äôt be able to download updates to TikTok, and the app could become  more buggy and difficult to use  over time. TikTok‚Äôs lawyer told the justices that the app would go dark after January 19. Blake Reid, a tech law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that the justices seemed to target TikTok‚Äôs corporate structure, leaving the app‚Äôs counsel little time to argue the merits of the data security argument. ‚ÄúI'm not sure that Tiktok will lose that argument, but because they spent so much time on it, they didn't get to make the arguments about the national security stuff and the privacy and security stuff, which I think is the weakest part of the government's case.‚Äù The justices seemed more sympathetic to the government‚Äôs security concerns, says Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor and former national security adviser to the Justice Department. ‚ÄúIt's very plausible that Tiktok picks up a couple of votes,‚Äù Rozenshtein says. ‚ÄúI think the three most likely are justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and maybe Kagan, but I struggle to see TikTok getting five votes, which is what it needs to strike down this law.‚Äù In a press conference following the hearing on Friday, Francisco said the argument went ‚Äúreally well‚Äù and that the justices ‚Äúvigorously questioned both sides.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear when the court would issue its decision, but Rozenshtein and Reid believe it will come sooner rather than later. TikTok‚Äôs lawyer, Francisco, suggested that the justices could issue a stay or an injunction to stop the ban from going into effect as scheduled, but they gave no signals as to whether they would consider it. Trump also pleaded with the nation‚Äôs highest court to stop the ban from going into effect in an amicus brief filed last month, promising to find a ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù solution to save TikTok once he retakes power. ‚ÄúPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing national security concerns,‚Äù Trump lawyer D. John Sauer wrote in  the filing.  The court has not yet responded to the brief. If the justices uphold the ban, a deal with Trump might just be TikTok‚Äôs last shot at survival.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-hearing/"},

This past weekend Ryan S√°nchez and three other members of his Nationalist Network group set up shop at the entrance to Santa Monica Pier. S√°nchez, who was  caught on video giving a Nazi salute  during last year‚Äôs Conservative Political Action Conference, and his crew had driven overnight from Arizona, where they live. S√°nchez, who was a member of the now-defunct white supremacist fight club known as the  Rise Above Movement , is an ally of white supremacist Nick Fuentes and is sometimes known by his online moniker ‚ÄúCulture War Criminal.‚Äù S√°nchez, who did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs requests for comment, claims on his social media accounts that his group ‚Äúgot much more support than anticipated‚Äù and said that all of the donations were given to the Bob Hope Patriotic Hall, a building said to be sheltering veterans as well as charities involved with military and veterans affairs. (It did not respond to a request to confirm that S√°nchez‚Äôs group made donations.) While S√°nchez and his colleagues claim they are in LA to do good, experts who track the activities of far-right groups tell WIRED that what they are really engaging in is ‚Äúdisaster tourism‚Äù to further their own agenda by appearing to do good for society. ‚ÄúBased on a lot of their past activities, this is probably being used as a recruitment effort, which is something that's been happening a lot more over the last year where far-right groups engage in disaster tourism,‚Äù says Freddy Cruz, the program manager for monitoring and training at Western States Center. ‚ÄúWe saw it with Hurricane Helene, and now we're seeing it again. These groups are essentially just traveling to disaster zones to create propaganda, solicit donations, and in some cases actually stealing donations from people on the ground.‚Äù On Monday, S√°nchez said that while his group was no longer collecting goods for the relief effort, it was still interested in meeting potential new recruits. ‚ÄúWe will not be accepting any more donations tomorrow, but if you are still interested in volunteering, contact us,‚Äù S√°nchez wrote on Telegram and X on Sunday morning. A donation link S√°nchez posted to his Telegram channel links directly to his personal Cash App account, and it‚Äôs unclear where any money being donated was going, though S√°nchez suggested it was being used to fund his group‚Äôs travel and accommodation. ‚ÄúThe crisis in Los Angeles continues, with high winds expected in the coming days. Thanks to your support, the Nationalist Network will be here for our fellow Americans,‚Äù S√°nchez wrote on his Telegram and X accounts on Monday, before asking for further donations ‚Äúif you would like to help keep our activists fed and in the fight.‚Äù As well as S√°nchez and the Nationalist Network, multiple  MAGA livestreamers  traveled to LA in recent days to begin posting content from the aftermath of the fires while at the same time soliciting money from their followers. One pair of livestreamers, who in the past have been featured on Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars platforms, produced a 17-minute ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù on the wildfires filled with disinformation about the source of the fires and the actions of the LA fire department. In some cases, livestreamers moved from documenting the aftermath of the fires to LARPing as firefighters. A livestreamer who is known online as Anthony Aguero, who typically livestreams from the US-Mexico border while pushing anti-immigrant disinformation, posted a video of himself tackling a fire he says he came across while driving in LA on Monday. ‚ÄúI jumped on to action and became a firefighter for a few minutes,‚Äù Aguero wrote on X. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how not 1 person tried to stop this fire, it took a guy from Texas to stop it.‚Äù The video shows Aguero carrying a bucket filled with water toward the flames; as he leaves, there are clearly still flames visible behind him. Aguero, who calls himself an ‚Äúindependent reporter bringing you raw truth,‚Äù also posted a video in which he was talking to Los Angeles Police Department officers on Sunday, claiming in accompanying text that 20 to 30 officers were involved in questioning him and a number of other people who were with him at the time after they were ‚ÄúSWATTED BY LEFTISTS.‚Äù In another video posted on YouTube, Aguero is seen chasing police cars through the streets of LA trying to see what incident they were responding to. Aguero didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. Aguero is one of numerous so-called citizen journalists who have filmed themselves in dangerous situations in recent days. Some appear in the midst of firefighters trying to tackle a blaze, at times traveling toward approaching fires rather than away from them. Other videos show them engaging in vigilantism, chasing people they allege to be looters while continuing to livestream to their followers. These videos are typically posted on X and YouTube, where livestreamers solicit donations or post links to their merchandise sites. Almost all of the streamers have blue checkmarks on X, which means their accounts are able to monetize the content they post.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-extremists-are-larping-as-emergency-workers-in-los-angeles/"},

Speaking to WIRED a few days before he‚Äôs set to step down from his post‚Äîone that still lacks a Trump nominee‚ÄîFick says he‚Äôs proud of the work that his relatively new State Department bureau has done and hopeful that Trump‚Äôs team will see the value in building on that legacy. Staying in the Game The Biden administration has spent years trying to convince ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to embrace the Western approach to technology and cybersecurity over China‚Äôs and Russia‚Äôs authoritarian visions. But it‚Äôs an open question whether Trump‚Äîwho has  disdained international institutions  and  insulted   a host of foreign countries ‚Äîwill continue this diplomatic campaign. To Fick, the persuasion strategy is a no-brainer, because it‚Äôs on the cusp of bearing real fruit. He‚Äôs confident that more and more countries investing in cutting-edge technology like 5G wireless networks will ultimately pick Western vendors over Chinese businesses, for two big reasons: the privacy and security risks of hiring companies that are subservient to China‚Äôs authoritarian regime and the lure of foreign direct investment (FDI) by Western governments looking for new supply chains free of untrustworthy electronics. ‚ÄúEvery country in the world is competing for this FDI by big global technology businesses, or tech-enabled businesses, and countries are going to be able to carve out an advantaged position for themselves if they're using trusted technology,‚Äù Fick says. ‚ÄúI think that's an argument that this next team is going to be all over.‚Äù One of the strategic shifts that Fick oversaw involved knitting together US campaigns to promote Western 5G vendors and to spur the construction of new undersea internet cables. ‚ÄúWe need to think about the full tech ecosystem,‚Äù he says. Two examples show the opportunities in this area. In Costa Rica, US support after  devastating Russian cyberattacks  helped convince San Jos√© to become a  regional leader  in  promoting Western 5G technology , making it a hub of foreign supply-chain investment. And last month, the tiny South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu broke ground on  its first undersea cable , financed by the US and Western allies. In Tuvalu, Fick says, ‚Äúwe preempted a generational buildout of fundamentally untrusted [Chinese] architecture.‚Äù Fick sees a chance for Trump‚Äôs administration to focus on these kinds of investments, with the strategy mirroring military-equipment sales to foreign governments, where diplomats arrange deals that improve partners‚Äô security and benefit US businesses. ‚ÄúThese are things that I've talked to the next team about,‚Äù he says. A Delicate Dance As China has become America‚Äôs preeminent cyber adversary, burrowing deep into  infrastructure like water facilities, power plants ,  and telecom networks , experts have wondered‚Äîand worried‚Äîabout the consequences of Trump‚Äôs bombastic approach to countering Beijing. ‚ÄúSocieties like ours are more vulnerable because we're more open and we're more connected,‚Äù Fick warns. ‚ÄúThe next team is going to have to be highly sensitive to our vulnerabilities in those areas.‚Äù Fick has discussed China‚Äôs cyber aggression with Trump‚Äôs team and predicts ‚Äúsome consistency on this front,‚Äù including ‚Äúa shared sense that we need to extend deterrence into the digital world.‚Äù Mike Waltz, Trump‚Äôs incoming national security adviser,  recently called for  a cyber version of mutually assured destruction. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre putting cyber time bombs in our ports and grid,‚Äù Waltz warned China, ‚Äúwe can do it to you, too, so let‚Äôs both not.‚Äù Imposing costs on China is imperative, Fick says‚Äîincluding, ‚Äúif necessary, military costs.‚Äù But as Trump embraces  the madman theory of international relations , Fick worries that China, too, is becoming increasingly reckless. ‚ÄúWe fear that they are mis-pricing the risk associated with‚Äù infrastructure intrusions, says Fick, who has been  deeply involved in the US response  to the attacks. US officials are also concerned that Beijing isn‚Äôt in full control of its hacker teams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre concerned that their system is not acting in a coordinated, unified way,‚Äù Fick says. ‚ÄúWe really need the Chinese to ensure that the cyber actors on their side are operating fully within the authority and under the control of senior political leadership.‚Äù Bracing for Change Trump‚Äôs election has inspired a wave of concern about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy, given the president-elect‚Äôs views on emerging technology issues and his controversial foreign ties. The Biden administration, for example,  launched a global effort  to  crack down  on commercial spyware that authoritarian regimes have used to suppress dissent. But Trump has close relationships with the countries fueling the spyware industry, including major customers  Saudi Arabia  and the  United Arab Emirates  and major exporter  Israel . Fick sounds uncertain about the spyware crackdown‚Äôs future, though he says Trump‚Äôs team includes ‚Äúsome very strong advocates for human rights online and digital freedom‚Äù and hopes ‚Äúthose voices will carry the day.‚Äù Biden has also tried to  marshal global support  for restrictions on AI to prevent both  existential  and  everyday  harms. Trump is  unlikely to back  similar AI safety regulations, but Fick argues that Biden‚Äôs team ‚Äústaked out a strong pro-innovation, pro-American position here that I would urge the next team to continue.‚Äù In his global travels since Trump‚Äôs election, Fick has heard from foreign counterparts who are deeply concerned about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy. European governments wonder if Trump will continue US support of Ukraine and NATO in a conflict with Russia that has partly  played out in cyberspace . Fick‚Äôs team was instrumental in  establishing a process  for rapidly delivering cyber-defense aid to Ukraine‚Äôs battered government. ‚ÄúI was in Ukraine right before Christmas, I was in Poland, I was in Estonia, kind of up and down NATO's eastern flank,‚Äù he says, adding that he sensed ‚Äúboth a deep desire for the United States to stay engaged and a recognition that European partners are going to need to do their share‚Äîwhich they, by the way, increasingly are doing.‚Äù More broadly, Fick has heard ‚Äúa strong desire among many allies and partners‚Äù for the US to continue going toe to toe with China and Russia in tech and cyber discussions in international bodies like the UN and the Group of 20. ‚ÄúWithout the United States deeply involved, you're going to see the Chinese more deeply involved, you're going to see the Russians more deeply involved,‚Äù Fick says. ‚ÄúThere's a pretty broad view [globally] that the US needs to, for its own interests and for the interests of our allies and partners, stay engaged in multilateral organizations.‚Äù Fick sympathizes with Republicans who consider these multilateral organizations too slow and timid, but he wants Trump‚Äôs team to ‚Äúrecognize that the alternative is not diminished influence of these organizations; the alternative is simply that they become playgrounds for our competitors and our adversaries.‚Äù Celebrating ‚Äúa Sea Change‚Äù Looking back on his time as America‚Äôs cyber ambassador‚Äîwhich saw him spend a total of more than 200 days traveling the world on nearly 80 trips to visit key US allies and partners‚ÄîFick is proud of how his team launched an entirely new bureau inside the State Department, grew it to around 130 employees, and delivered results that he says are transforming digital diplomacy. One of his biggest accomplishments was the launch of  a foreign cyber aid fund  that  will support programs  to deploy security assistance to hack-stricken allies, subsidize new undersea cables, and train foreign diplomats on cyber issues. The security-assistance project saw an early test in November when Costa Rica faced another major ransomware attack. ‚ÄúWe had people on a plane the next morning, Thanksgiving morning, with hands on keyboards alongside Costa Rican partners that night,‚Äù Fick says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing. That is a sea change in how we do this, and it‚Äôs going to strengthen our hand in providing support to these middle-ground states.‚Äù Fick has also focused on preparing the Foreign Service for the modern world, meeting his goal of  training at least one tech-savvy diplomat  for every foreign embassy (around 237 total) and successfully lobbying to add digital fluency to the State Department‚Äôs criteria for career ambassador positions. He has also helped State counterbalance the Pentagon in White House discussions about foreign tech issues‚Äîputting ‚ÄúAmerican diplomacy literally back at the table in the Situation Room on technology topics.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs his team‚Äôs support for US cyber aid to Ukraine, from security software to satellite communications to cloud migration for vital government data‚Äîwork that he says offers a template for future public-private foreign-aid partnerships. One Final Warning Fick has shared his thoughts about China, 5G, AI, deterrence, and other cyber issues with Trump‚Äôs transition team, and he says there‚Äôs still more to do to keep cyber diplomacy ‚Äúfront and center‚Äù at State. But as he prepares to leave government, he has one major piece of advice for the incoming administration. ‚ÄúIt is essential to have a bias for action,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe end up admiring a problem for too long rather than taking a decisive step to address it ‚Ä¶ That decisive step may be imperfect, but indecision is a decision, and the world moves on without you.‚Äù Put another way: In an era of rapidly evolving technologies and intensifying geopolitical competition, massive bureaucracies like the State Department sometimes need to be jolted into action. ‚ÄúThe job of the leaders in these big organizations,‚Äù Fick says, ‚Äúis to move the org to change a little bit faster than it would on its own.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/nathaniel-fick-us-cyber-ambassador-exit-interview/"},

The executive order instructs the US Attorney General to abstain from enforcing the law that would ban the app and require companies like Apple and Google to remove it from their app stores. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Days before the January 19 deadline, Trump suggested that he would ‚Äúsave‚Äù the app once he formally took office.  In an interview with Kristen Welker at NBC News on Saturday , Trump said that he would give ByteDance more time to find a buyer but did not explain how he planned to do so. ‚ÄúWe have to look at it carefully. It‚Äôs a very big situation,‚Äù he said. In a Truth Social post on Sunday , Trump confirmed that the extension would be done by way of an executive order that would allow his administration to negotiate a deal with ByteDance. In his post, Trump said that he would pursue a 50 percent joint venture agreement with ByteDance, preferably with a US entity. ‚ÄúBy doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay] up,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúWithout US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars‚Äîmaybe trillions.‚Äù ByteDance and TikTok have yet to publicly respond to Trump‚Äôs proposal. At the Monday signing ceremony, Trump said that he thinks TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew would ‚Äúreally like it.‚Äù Trump said private companies could be involved in financing the negotiation. ‚ÄúI think you have a lot of people that will be interested in TikTok with the United States as a partner,‚Äù he said. The executive order itself doesn't mention divestiture but instead says that the 75-day reprieve is for the ‚Äúopportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way.‚Äù The rush to keep TikTok online came after the company suffered a devastating blow at the hands of the  US Supreme Court . On Friday, the court upheld a law forcing a sale of TikTok to an American owner in order to stave off a nationwide ban. The decision came only two days before the law was set to go into effect. Shortly before midnight on Saturday, TikTok users received a notification alerting them that the app was no longer available to US users as a result of the sell-or-ban law. Around the same time Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores, other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap, were also taken down. TikTok was down for around 15 hours before the company issued a statement announcing that it would return. ‚ÄúIn agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,‚Äù the company said  Sunday  evening. The divestiture law has faced resentment from both sides of the aisle. ‚ÄúIn Washington DC doing meetings trying to get this TikTok ban lifted,‚Äù wrote Soulja Boy in a  post on X over the weekend.  The rap artist was in town to perform at a crypto industry inauguration party. A variety of American financiers  considered buying the app , including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and former Trump treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. McCourt‚Äôs Project Liberty  made a formal bid  after the Supreme Court announced its decision. Elon Musk‚Äôs name was also floated in talks about a deal with the Chinese government,  according to Bloomberg . On Monday, Trump suggested that he could impose retaliatory tariffs against China if the Chinese government refuses to negotiate a deal resolving the US government‚Äôs national security concerns with TikTok. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I would, but you could certainly do it,‚Äù he said.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-executive-order-tiktok-ban/"},

It came after weeks of Musk‚Äôs efforts to boost the far-right party, which has  deep links   to neo-Nazism  and has been surveilled for suspected extremism by Germany‚Äôs own intelligence services. ‚Äú[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,‚Äù Weidel said in response to Musk asking about media reports linking the AfD to Nazism. ‚ÄúThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,‚Äù Weidel said. ‚ÄúHe wasn't a conservative, he wasn't a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Musk responded. In his autobiography  Mein Kampf , Hitler‚Äîwho as leader of the German Reich was responsible for the invasion of the Soviet Union and the enslavement and death of millions of its citizens‚Äîrepeatedly describes communism as an enemy of the German nation. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to control Germany and the world. Weidel also compared the Nazi Party‚Äôs views to those of modern-day left-wing political groups who support Palestine in the face of what a UN commission has called  crimes against humanity conducted by Israel . While her AfD colleagues were last month seen  attending a secretive meeting organized by former members of a militant neo-Nazi group  known for burning the Israeli flag, she said, ‚ÄúThe AfD is the ‚Äã‚Äãonly protector of the Jewish people here in Germany.‚Äù Weidel is the AfD‚Äôs candidate for chancellor in Germany‚Äôs snap elections, which take place next month. As someone who previously worked in finance and lives in Switzerland with her wife, who is from Sri Lanka, and their children, she has been presented as a relatively moderate face for the party. This is something Musk picked up on in an op-ed he penned last month for a German newspaper. \"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka,‚Äù Musk wrote. ‚ÄúDoes that sound like Hitler to you? Please!‚Äù Ahead of the conversation on Thursday, the EU said that it would be monitoring the event to see if it was artificially promoted to voters in Germany, something which would be in violation of the region‚Äôs sweeping Digital Service Act rules. A European Commission spokesperson told WIRED it would not be commenting on the contents of the livestream. Weidel referenced the EU‚Äôs preoccupation with the conversation, claiming 150 officials at the EU commission were listening in, then claimed the DSA was a censorship tool, before adding: ‚ÄúYou know what Adolf Hitler did? He switched off free speech. He controlled the media, and without that he would have never been successful.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, exactly,‚Äù Musk responded. The conversation, which was billed as an interview but was more of a love-in, hit virtually event major culture war topic, from the war in Ukraine, where Weidel suggested European government‚Äôs lack of strategy would push Russia toward nuclear war, to immigration, where Musk wildly claimed that ‚Äúon the Mexican side of the border in the US is a giant pile of discarded passports and drivers‚Äô licenses, like a huge pile.‚Äù It was unclear what Musk was talking about, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk also claimed that ‚Äúbasically theft is legal in California‚Äù and said that the only thing that would slow down what ‚Äúthe influx of criminals‚Äù were stealing is ‚Äúif your back hurts from carrying out all the goods.‚Äù The centibillionaire‚Äôs interest in German politics, and the AfD in particular, appear to have been largely informed by a single X user, Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German influencer who rose to prominence by posting climate change and Covid-19 denial content. After she posted an image of herself in June saying she had voted for the AfD in last year‚Äôs European elections, Musk shared her post, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?‚Äù He then slid into her DMs,  Seibt told Reuters . \"I explained to him the AfD is not similar to the Nazi ideology or Hitler but is like the 19th century liberal nationalist movement ... because they wanted to be free from authoritarians in their own territory,\" Seibt told the outlet. Musk engaged with the 24-year-old 40 more times before sharing one of her posts on December 20 with the comment: ‚ÄúOnly the AfD can save Germany.‚Äù A week later  an op-ed with Musk‚Äôs byline  appeared in the German Welt am Samstag newspaper claiming that the AfD was the ‚Äúlast spark of hope‚Äù for Germany. Musk repeated his endorsement during the livestream, saying, ‚ÄúI think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person, and hopefully people can tell just from this conversation. Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear whether Musk‚Äôs endorsement of Weidel and the AfD will have any material impact on the outcome of the election. ‚ÄúIn the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,‚Äù Manfred G√ºllner, the head of the Forsa Institute,  told Politico . ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see very much potential for future change, because Musk has become a negative figure.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-far-right-german-leader-weidel-hitler-communist/"},

Nearly five years later, one of the opening salvos of Trump‚Äôs second term has been to  again initiate the process of withdrawing  the US from the WHO. The move is already drawing both controversy and the threat of legal challenges. According to a  1948 joint resolution  passed by both houses of Congress, any such withdrawal requires the US to provide the WHO with one year‚Äôs notice, but it appears that Trump‚Äôs intentions are to withdraw immediately and do so without seeking congressional approval. ‚ÄúThe executive order announces the immediate withdrawal from WHO, and he‚Äôs not seeking congressional authorization, and he‚Äôs also not giving the required one year‚Äôs notice,‚Äù says Lawrence Gostin, a professor in public health law at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC, and one of the coauthors of the 2020 Lancet article. ‚ÄúIn my view, this is reckless and it‚Äôs lawless, and it needs to be challenged in court.‚Äù Trump has a long history of criticizing the WHO, previously accusing the organization of being ‚Äúcorrupt,‚Äù ripping off America, and ‚Äúseverely mismanaging and covering up‚Äù the spread of Covid-19. The US has historically been one of the WHO‚Äôs largest funders, with some estimates suggesting that it provides a fifth of the organization‚Äôs entire budget. Between 2022 and 2023, the US provided the WHO with  nearly $1.3 billion . However, Gostin and others are particularly concerned about the impacts of a US withdrawal on the country‚Äôs ability to manage the ongoing threat of infectious diseases. While the WHO has a far-reaching remit, ranging from advice on essential medicines to public policy recommendations on everything from tobacco and drug use to road safety, it is arguably most impactful when it comes to the surveillance of potentially problematic new diseases, such as bird flu, and coordinating an international response. ‚ÄúWithdrawing from WHO makes us more alone, more vulnerable, and more fragile in the world,‚Äù says Gostin. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt shut down a border against a pathogen. We need WHO to be on the ground to put out fires before they get to the United States. And we also need WHO‚Äôs vast network to provide us with the information about mutations and viruses that we need to develop life-saving vaccines and medical treatments.‚Äù According to Sten Vermund, chief medical officer of the Global Virus Network and another coauthor of The Lancet article, what happens next depends on the reactions of other countries and nongovernment organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which all provide the WHO with significant funding. After Trump cut US contributions to the WHO to $680 million in 2020‚Äì21, Germany  responded  by quadrupling its contributions to more than $1 billion. The Danish government  also agreed  to double its contributions, placing a strong emphasis on improving sexual and reproductive health and tackling the rise of non-communicable diseases. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is trying to downsize the WHO, and the question is whether other high-income nations like those in Europe, Australia, Japan, and elsewhere, pick up some of the slack,‚Äù says Vermund. ‚ÄúWill the Gates Foundation, which has been a very generous donor, pick up some? It‚Äôs conceivable that others will tide things over until we have a new administration that might be more friendly to the WHO, but I‚Äôm dubious that they can pick up the entire chunk of the WHO budget which is paid for by the US.‚Äù And it isn‚Äôt just money that the US provides to the WHO, but staff and expertise too. ‚ÄúThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seconded a number of staff to the WHO, and I would predict that the Trump administration, with a new CDC director, will call those folks home,‚Äù says Vermund. ‚ÄúThat would create quite a gap, because WHO funds do not pay for those individuals. So I think you‚Äôd have an almost immediate reduction of workforce and removal of critical professionals within the WHO organization.‚Äù According to Gostin, a lot of the money the US provides to the WHO is core mandatory funding, which all members are required to give, but some funds are particularly earmarked for causes in which the US has a vested interest, such as polio eradication, HIV/AIDS, and the process of identifying and controlling disease outbreaks before they spread and reach American shores. Without US funding, Gostin says that these programs wouldn‚Äôt completely disappear, but they would be significantly weakened. ‚ÄúPolio could come surging back,‚Äù says Gostin. ‚ÄúRemember we had polio in the wastewater in New York just a couple of years ago, and our kids are not being immunized. And we‚Äôve had other real health scares in the United States, not just Covid-19, which killed more than a million people. We‚Äôve had Zika, and the next health emergency might be just a mutation or two away. Maybe it‚Äôs already here in the form of avian influenza, and we‚Äôre going to need WHO to help us with that.‚Äù Both Gostin and Vermund fear that withdrawing from the WHO will place the US at the back of the line when it comes to receiving critical information such as pathogen samples and genomic sequencing data, which pharmaceutical companies require to generate effective vaccines. Gostin cites how the US relies on WHO data every year to effectively update the seasonal influenza vaccine, while Vermund explains that financially speaking, it is far more efficient for the US to fund the WHO to help ‚Äúsnuff out‚Äù diseases at their source, rather than trying to tackle them when they arrive in the country. ‚ÄúWe spent over $2 billion preparing for Ebola to hit US shores in 2014 and 2015, and since we only had five or six cases, that was very cost-ineffective,‚Äù says Vermund. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs a typical example of how when the US goes it alone, it will be very inefficient compared with contributing to a multinational response to control a disease in the country of origin.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs decision does have one historical precedent, with Ronald Reagan‚Äôs administration being equally critical of the WHO throughout the 1980s. By the end of 1987, the WHO was facing the worst budget crisis in its history after the US delayed sending promised payments and recalled staff, despite the emergence of HIV/AIDS as a global killer. Public health experts at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have  since criticized this  as contributing to the AIDS crisis. Gostin believes that instead of paying less, the US should be putting pressure on other leading global powers such as China, Russia, Brazil, and India to pay more to the WHO to help support traditionally underfunded issues, such as the need to train more doctors and nurses in Africa, address the global rise of chronic diseases, and improve measures that can make us better prepared for the next pandemic. Because of the potential impact of Trump‚Äôs decision, Gostin told WIRED that he is currently seeking cross-party political backing to potentially file a lawsuit to the Supreme Court, challenging Trump‚Äôs executive order. ‚ÄúTrump believes he can do it on his own,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I think this is too consequential and momentous a decision for the president to make unilaterally on a whim, or as a grudge against WHO. It‚Äôs important enough that we need Congress to weigh in.‚Äù For now, Vermund says that having made the WHO withdrawal a priority at the start of his presidency, it is highly likely that Trump will ultimately be able to get it over the line. While the US is supposed to fulfil its financial obligations to the agency for 2025, he also doubts that this will happen. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs initiating it very early in his presidency, on day one, and that gives him a lot of time to negotiate Congress and the courts if it should come to that,‚Äù says Vermund. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt pay his bills to an international agency, I‚Äôm not aware of any enforcement mechanism that is available. He may choose to ignore the agreements and go forward without formal legal authority.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-plan-to-leave-the-who-health-disaster/"},

Reffitt has spent most of the last four years in hiding, constantly on the move every few months. He was the person who  tipped off the FBI  about his father‚Äôs involvement in the insurrection. Jackson‚Äôs father, Guy Reffitt, was a member of the Texas Three Percenter group when he stormed the Capitol wearing body armor and carrying a pistol and zip ties. He was caught on camera urging other rioters to storm the Capitol building and told members of his militia group that he intended to drag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of the building by her ankles, ‚Äúwith her head hitting every step on the way down.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump himself has given him a presidential pardon to let him be free. That validation is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience that he's never going to get again,‚Äù Reffitt tells WIRED. ‚ÄúI can't imagine what he's going to be willing to do now. It could get a whole hell of a lot worse.‚Äù Reffitt is ‚Äúterrified‚Äù about what is going to happen next and has armed himself with a handgun and a rifle to protect himself and his boyfriend. Over the past few years, he has been targeted, harassed, and threatened online. Since Trump pardoned everyone, the threats are becoming even more intense. In the last 24 hours ‚Äúit's gotten worse than ever,‚Äù Reffitt tells WIRED. ‚ÄúI think just because, yet again, the validation that Trump is bringing is just making people a whole lot more emboldened to just say some vile, disgusting shit.‚Äù Reffitt is not the only family member of a released January 6 prisoner who is concerned about the fallout from Trump‚Äôs blanket pardons. Tasha Adams, the ex-wife of Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes, who had his 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy commuted by Trump, is also worried about what might happen. ‚ÄúStewart is out of prison now and, frankly, I could really use a bit of a run fund, in case it comes to that,‚Äù  Adams wrote  on her GoFundMe page on Tuesday, hours after her ex-husband was released from prison. The investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol became the biggest in Justice Department history and left many far-right militia groups in the country in ruins. But with a single pen stroke on Monday night, Trump has reinvigorated the militia movement, freeing their most prominent figures, including Rhodes and  Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio . ‚ÄúOne of things I‚Äôm most concerned about is the risk of groups that were decimated after J6 coming back stronger, especially since many of them had their sentences commuted or were outright pardoned,‚Äù says Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University‚Äôs Program on Extremism. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if the Oath Keepers began making more appearances, and seeing the Proud Boys accelerate their culture war tactics, especially against the LGBTQ community, like we‚Äôve seen before. Their leaders are free, they have a lot to catch up on, and they are likely feeling vindicated.‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a family member of a January 6 prisoner who is being released? We‚Äôd like to hear from you.

In October, he sent another text message to the same acquaintance, writing: ‚ÄúI do love the J6 family dynamics. We really are a ‚ÄòYuge‚Äô family now. We all have a common goal. Save America and the people.‚Äù Jackson Reffitt believes that his father has become even more extreme in prison. ‚ÄúHe's gotten worse throughout the years,‚Äù says Reffitt. ‚ÄúHe's gotten more radicalized, and now he gets out, and now he can buy a gun, and now he can do whatever he wants. That is just so terrifying to me.‚Äù After Trump signed the executive order, Jackson Reffitt switched on his laptop and began watching the celebrations at Freedom Corner, a site next to the DC Jail where activists have gathered every night for more than 900 days to call for the release of January 6 prisoners. On camera, one of the leaders of Freedom Corner was shouting out the names of people who were going to be released, including many prisoners who had been convicted of violently assaulting police officers. The crowd responded to each name with loud cheers. As Reffitt watched in terror, he saw people in the crowd that he recognized: his mother Nicole Reffitt and sisters Peyton and Sarah. Nicole Reffitt has become one of the most prominent organizers of the January 6 vigils at Freedom Corner in recent years, moving from their family home in Texas to Washington, DC, full time. When WIRED spoke to Reffitt in the days after Trump‚Äôs election victory in November, she sought to strike a conciliatory tone, claiming that she was not calling for the release of all prisoners. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe a blanket pardon is appropriate. A blanket pardon would give everyone a pass. There should be accountability. If you broke the law you should be held accountable.‚Äù Her son doesn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúShe never cared; she was trying to pander to a more inclusive audience. She wanted them free,‚Äù says Jackson Reffit, adding that his relationship with his mother is irreparably broken. His boyfriend is transitioning, and Jackson has not forgotten the slurs his mother has used about the LGBTQ community in online streams and publications. Nicole Reffitt did not respond to messages and calls from WIRED. Jackson Reffitt says he is safe for now and that he will eventually speak to his father, but not for some time. ‚ÄúOnce I feel situated, and once I figure out what's going on with him and everything, then I can work on [contacting him],‚Äù Reffitt said. ‚ÄúBut right now I can‚Äôt.

This measure is in response to the strict  immigration policy  that President Donald Trump announced on January 20, and which has already begun to materialize with the closure of the CBP One app. CBP One was launched in 2020, allowing foreign vendors to schedule cargo inspections. In 2023 the Biden administration expanded its functions to include unauthorized migrants seeking asylum. This Monday, on Inauguration Day, an order from Donald Trump put an end to the program, and thousands of scheduled appointments were canceled. Rosa Icela Rodr√≠guez, head of the Ministry of the Interior (SEGOB), unveiled the project during the morning conference of Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Rodr√≠guez explained that the strategy includes economic support of 2,000 pesos (about $100) for Mexican citizens who lack the resources to return to their communities of origin. This support will be delivered through the new Bienestar Paisano Card. Federal authorities add that the plan is designed to allow Mexican migrants to join existing social programs, which include pensions for senior citizens and people with disabilities, scholarships for elementary and high school students, and the initiatives Sembrando Vida, Mujeres con Bienestar, J√≥venes Construyendo el Futuro, and Salud Casa por Casa. Repatriated Mexicans will be affiliated with the Mexican Social Security Institute. The program will grant them access to insurance for sickness and maternity, work risks, disability and life, retirement, and for severance in advanced age and old age. They will also be able to enjoy all social benefits and childcare services provided by the Social Security Law. The benefits will extend to the spouses or partners, children, and parents of the deportee. Rodriguez adds that Mexicans expelled from the United States will also receive legal advice to help them obtain documents of identification, such as birth certificates, voter's credentials, and the Clave √önica de Registro de Poblaci√≥n (Unique Population Registry Code). They will also have access to social housing support provided by the Ministry of Agrarian, Territorial, and Urban Development and by the National Workers' Housing Fund Institute (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores). The SEGOB has trained public servants from the governments of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Michoac√°n, Guanajuato, State of Mexico, Sinaloa, and Jalisco for the proper implementation of the Mexico Embraces You plan. It claims to have coordinated efforts with the Human Rights Commission and the Business Coordinating Council. Trump‚Äôs Possible Mass Deportations Donald Trump confirmed in his inaugural address that he will declare a state of emergency on  the Mexican border  to stop what he called ‚Äúan invasion by illegal intruders.‚Äù He has promised to act ‚Äúwith historic speed and force.‚Äù His statements have begun to take effect. US Customs and Border Protection has confirmed that features of the CBP One mobile app that allowed undocumented immigrants to submit information in advance and schedule appointments at eight southwest border ports of entry are no longer available. The agency added that appointments scheduled through the app have been canceled. The app was launched in 2021 to streamline immigration flow and processes in the border region. The tool was designed to serve undocumented migrants from central and northern Mexico and ‚Äúavoid border pressure from those arriving seeking asylum,‚Äù according to Mexican authorities. Sheinbaum anticipated its closure in a statement from the SEGOB, published before Trump's inauguration. She said that ‚Äúthis application has helped migrants not have to go to the northern border to wait for asylum. We are going to propose that this application or other related ones be allowed.‚Äù Juan Ram√≥n de la Fuente, secretary of foreign affairs, announced the creation of the ConsulApp platform. The system will have three essential functions: alerting the nearest Mexican consulate to initiate legal assistance in real time, notifying family members or trusted contacts selected by the migrant about his or her legal situation, and directly warning the Foreign Ministry, which will supervise compliance with due process. The Mexican president emphasized that migrants are essential to the economy, and reaffirmed her support to Mexican nationals through the 53 consulates throughout the United States.

On Monday, when signing the executive order in the Oval Office,  Trump  said that ‚Äú Mexico  probably won't be happy.‚Äù But this proposal is not new‚Äîin his first term as president, Trump tried to impose this designation but was eventually dissuaded by Mexican authorities, who pledged to cooperate with the United States to combat cartels. The idea of designating cartels as terrorists is decades old. \"This began to be discussed in the 1980s, during Ronald Reagan's administration, when drug trafficking began to be associated with the threat to national security. Since then, both Democrats and Republicans have promoted the concept of 'narcoterrorism,'\" says Oswaldo Zavala, author of  Drug Cartels Do Not Exist: Narcotrafficking in US and Mexican Culture. Now, the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has maintained that the bilateral relationship should be based on cooperation and not subordination, is obliged to treat the issue of migration and drug trafficking with caution. ‚ÄúOur relationship with the United States will be one of equals,‚Äù said Sheinbaum. She said she expects a dialog between the two countries to take place soon. \"We will enter into communication and we know that there will be an agreement on different issues ‚Ä¶ reaching agreements on migration issues, recognition of the work of Mexicans in the United States, drug trafficking, weapons that cross from the United States to Mexico, cultural issues and, of course, trade issues. Always as equals,\" said the president. Mexico is one of the largest trading partners of the United States. Fracturing the relationship could have economic repercussions, including millions of US jobs. ‚ÄúThe concept of  narcoterrorism  amplifies the power of pressure, blackmail and, ultimately, this notion could usher in a new era of political violence justified by this discourse.‚Äù Oswaldo Zavala, author of  Drug Cartels Do Not Exist In the order issued Monday, Trump specifically mentioned two criminal groups operating within the United States: the Venezuelan-born Aragua Train and the Salvadoran-born MS-13. Using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, his administration could implement additional measures to dismantle the financial networks of these organizations. The narrative of US government extortion of the Mexican government has come from both Democrats and Republicans. One proponent of this idea was Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúClinton represented an interventionist stance. This approach is characterized by a hostile and militaristic view towards Latin America. In this context, Donald Trump appears to be continuing, in a more aggressive way, the already violent anti-drug policy of the United States. Over the decades, this policy has become progressively more violent and hostile. In the 1940s, military actions focused on eradicating crops such as marijuana and opium. However, in the 1980s, a more systematic fight against alleged criminal organizations began, and by the 1990s, a closer collaboration between the army and the police was consolidated, which led to an increasing militarization of public life in Mexico,\" says Zavala, who also holds a PhD in philosophy. ‚ÄúMy concern is that the concept of narcoterrorism amplifies the power of pressure, blackmail and, ultimately, this notion could inaugurate a new era of political violence justified by this discourse,‚Äù he adds. \"In the 1980s, a more systematic fight against alleged criminal organizations began, and by the 1990s, a closer collaboration between the army and the police was consolidated, leading to an increasing militarization of public life in Mexico.\" Oswaldo Zavala, author of  Drug Cartels Do Not Exist . Cartels Could Turn Into Real Terrorist Organizations Supporters of the designation often point to violence against Americans as justification. But military action against the cartels could lead to more organized attacks against Americans, even within the United States. \"Drug cartels could easily become full-blown terrorist organizations,\" said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation. Trump's executive order could be turned against the United States. And the difference is that we have stopped talking about marijuana and heroin, gradually shifting to synthetic drugs, with fentanyl being the most serious public health case in recent times, with 70,000 people dying from the synthetic opioid in 2023. ‚ÄúThe problem with fentanyl is its ease of trafficking: It has no smell, comes in small pills, and is extremely discreet. In addition, most of those who traffic fentanyl are Americans, as are most of the users. This creates a paradox typical of drug policy. While there is talk of Mexican narco-terrorists, studies conducted in the United States show that the main perpetrators of fentanyl trafficking and consumption are Americans,‚Äù Zavala says. This raises fundamental questions. \"If they are going to designate traffickers as narco-terrorists, will they also include the Americans who are part of these networks? Because we are not just talking about the famous drug cartels, but also trafficking networks, money laundering, arms smuggling and other structures, many of which are incorporated in the United States. There is an enormous complexity in defining where a cartel begins and where it ends. There is a dispersion of actors, organizations and relationships on both sides of the border involved in drug trafficking. Therefore, to speak of narcoterrorism is to speak of something vague and imprecise. This term is not supported by concrete evidence; rather, its use is eminently political,\" argues Zavala. According to Zavala, the narrative allows figures like President Trump to use the concept of narcoterrorism as a tool of intimidation, threat and extortion towards the Mexican government. ‚ÄúRather than describing realities, narcoterrorism is based on spectral notions, on political phantoms that are used to force Mexico to align with Washington's interests,‚Äù he says. An Executive Order to Intervene Militarily in Mexico Intervening militarily in Mexican territory with selective incursions aimed at damaging the cartels is something that has been on the US radar screen for some time now. But analysts argue that it would be a shot in the foot for the Trump administration. \"By using the concept of narcoterrorism, the US government empowers itself to intervene militarily in Mexico. That is something very complicated, because intervening in that way would seriously damage the binational relationship, which is very delicate. It is almost inconceivable [the idea of military aggression],\" Zavala explains. \"I believe that in addition to the bravado, the Mexican government has generally been aligned because in the end our security policy has always been subordinated and violated; even subalternized by the United States.\" This Wednesday, the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said that the secretary of foreign affairs, Juan Ram√≥n de la Fuente, had a telephone conversation with US secretary of state Marco Rubio. She did not provide details of the conversation, but said it was \"a very cordial conversation\" and they discussed ‚Äúmigration and security issues.‚Äù Rubio has said that he would prefer that any action, any decision taken from Washington have the consent, the collaboration of the Mexican government. ‚ÄúCartels Do Not Exist‚Äù Oswaldo Zavala  (Ciudad Juarez, 1975) has specialized in Mexican narrative, and has an alternative vision of the narco phenomenon in Mexico. He believes that the image of the power of the cartels is exaggerated and sponsored by the State. The author of  The Imaginary U.S.‚ÄîMexico Drug Wars: State Power, Organized Crime, and the Political History of Narconarratives (1975‚Äì2012) , explains to WIRED that the war against drug trafficking is generally built on fantastical, contradictory and often absurd concepts, which gradually form an imaginary that presents drug trafficking in an alarmist manner. \"The US government has managed with great skill to create a long list of concepts, monsters and criminal actors that not only dominate the public debate in the United States, but also in Mexico. Thus, when Americans want it, one organization or another becomes the center of discussion. In the 1980s, for example, it was the Guadalajara Cartel, with figures such as Rafael Caro Quintero and Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. In the 1990s, the central figure was El Chapo Guzman, and later, Amado Carrillo. Today, the conversation revolves around fentanyl and, above all, the Sinaloa Cartel,\" Zavala explains. \"The US government has skillfully managed to create a long list of concepts,  monsters  and criminal actors that not only dominate the public debate in their country, but also in Mexico.\" Oswaldo Zavala, author of  Drug Cartels Do Not Exist Zavala argues that the narratives used by the US government are ways of simplifying a complex problem, giving a common sense to the debate that would otherwise be much more complicated. \"If we take into account that a large part of drug consumption occurs in the United States, that there are organizations within that country that facilitate trafficking, launder money and, in many cases, are as or more dangerous than the Mexican ones, the discussion becomes much more complex for the Mexican panorama. What these narratives do, then, is to simplify the situation, presenting Mexico as the primary enemy of US security. In doing so, the US government can intervene not only mediatically but also politically, diplomatically, and even militarily in Mexico,\" he says. ‚ÄúAs citizens we must be very careful with the narratives that are generated from Washington,‚Äù he warns. \"It is essential to learn to analyze them critically and to distance ourselves from what we are being told. This process is neither easy nor quick, since, unfortunately, not only the Mexican government repeats these narratives, but the media also replicates them, and sometimes institutions and other actors push them. And, to complicate things even more, a popular culture is created that feeds these ideas: today there are already  corridos  about fentanyl, about the ‚ÄòChapitos‚Äô and about the supposed criminal empires of the cartels. It is very difficult to escape from all this.\" A War That Has Left More Than 100,000 People Missing More than 100,000 people have been missing in Mexico since 1964, when the count began. The National Registry of Disappeared and Unaccounted for Persons has for months now exceeded this figure, which is evidence of the grave situation in the country. Most of these people were registered as missing since 2006, when the administration of Felipe Calder√≥n, who took the army to the streets to combat the violence of organized crime, began. \"Many of the most serious effects of the anti-drug policy we have been suffering in Mexico for decades. More than half a million murders since the militarization began with President Calderon, more than 100,000 forced disappearances. We know that all that violence is unloaded, above all, against poor, racialized, brown young people, who live in the most disadvantaged areas of the country,\" says Zavala, who is surprised when people are alarmed by what Trump says. \"As if we weren't already living, for years now, a really serious wave of violence in the country.\" \"I think we still don't fully understand that this violence has a clear class dimension. It is not generalized violence, but systematized and directed against the most vulnerable sectors of society.\" Oswaldo Zavala, author of  Drug Cartels Do Not Exist According to the researcher, military violence is often expressed as a form of social control, as a management of violence. \"You're not going to see militarization in areas like the Condesa or Roma, but in the margins of Mexico City, in the most impoverished areas. The violence is happening in the peripheries, in the poorest neighborhoods, where there is not even adequate monitoring by the media or human rights institutions,\" Zavala says. What should surprise us, Zavala says, are the very high rates of violence we are experiencing, as a background of what is already happening, not of something that is yet to come. \"I think we still don't fully understand that this violence has a clear class dimension. It is not generalized violence, but systematized and directed against the most vulnerable sectors of society,\" he says. The Solution: Demilitarizing the Country The decision taken by Calder√≥n 16 years ago to entrust the Army with the responsibility of public security in several areas of the country has shown us its fatal consequences. Both Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador pledged, during their respective electoral campaigns, to return peace, security, and civility to us. However, once in power, both presented proposals to consolidate, through legislation and even constitutional reforms, the militarized public security model. The situation does not seem to change with Claudia Sheinbaum's administration. \"Most of the violence in Mexico is not necessarily linked to drug trafficking, but to the very experience of militarization.\" Oswaldo Zavala, author of 'Cartels don't exist' In this way, Mexico's recent presidents have maintained a \"peace and security\" policy based on a militarized strategy, justifying it on the supposed operational incapacity of police corporations to confront organized crime. ‚ÄúI agree with the view that drugs need to be decriminalized, addictions treated, all that. But in my opinion, most of the violence in Mexico is not necessarily linked to drug trafficking, but to the experience of militarization itself. And I think there is solid empirical data to support this idea. We know that there is a ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and an ‚Äòafter‚Äô militarization in Mexico,‚Äù Zavala explains. ‚ÄúBefore the deployment of the army, our homicide rates were declining throughout the country, and there is a direct correlation between military occupation, the presence of the armed forces, and the increase in homicides and forced disappearances.‚Äù In Zavala's opinion, the only way out of this spiral of violence in Mexico is to demilitarize the country. But it's not as simple as it might sound. Militarism is part of a global trend, and we are living in an era in which all Western democracies are becoming increasingly militarized, with effects similar to those we have experienced in Mexico. \"Military violence in the United States, for example, is also being discharged against minority and racialized populations, and, in addition, we have an unstoppable flow of weapons going from the global north to the global south. All of this is accompanied by extremely violent policies of control and  security  that in reality translate into extermination strategies and operations,\" he says. \"I don't see many ways out, because while L√≥pez Obrador's government fills its mouth with speeches about sovereignty, militarism continues to advance. They continue to defend crimes against humanity committed by the army, they continue to detain and deport migrants, and they continue to use the army as a force for violence and social control. I don't believe there is any real will to dismantle the infrastructure of violence that militarization has created in Mexico.\" This story originally appeared on   WIRED   en Espa√±ol   and has been translated from Spanish.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-executive-order-mexico-drug-cartels-terrorist-organizations/"},

The  40-page executive order  unveiled on Thursday is the Biden White House‚Äôs final attempt to kickstart efforts to harness the security benefits of AI, roll out digital identities for US citizens, and close gaps that have helped China, Russia, and other adversaries  repeatedly   penetrate  US government systems. The order ‚Äúis designed to strengthen America‚Äôs digital foundations and also put the new administration and the country on a path to continued success,‚Äù Anne Neuberger, Biden‚Äôs deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters on Wednesday. Looming over Biden‚Äôs directive is the question of whether president-elect Donald Trump will continue any of these initiatives after he takes the oath of office on Monday. None of the highly technical projects decreed in the order are partisan, but Trump‚Äôs advisers may prefer different approaches (or timetables) to solving the problems that the order identifies. Trump hasn‚Äôt named any of his top cyber officials, and Neuberger said the White House didn‚Äôt discuss the order with his transition staff, ‚Äúbut we are very happy to, as soon as the incoming cyber team is named, have any discussions during this final transition period.‚Äù The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents‚Äînamely, the security failures of federal contractors. The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on  a mandate that debuted  in 2022 in response to  Biden‚Äôs first cyber executive order . The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would be tasked with double-checking these security attestations and working with vendors to fix any problems. To put some teeth behind the requirement, the White House‚Äôs Office of the National Cyber Director is ‚Äúencouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General‚Äù for potential investigation and prosecution. The order gives the Department of Commerce eight months to assess the most commonly used cyber practices in the business community and issue guidance based on them. Shortly thereafter, those practices would become mandatory for companies seeking to do business with the government. The directive also kicks off updates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology‚Äôs  secure software development guidance . Another part of the directive focuses on the protection of cloud platforms‚Äô authentication keys, the compromise of which opened the door for China‚Äôs  theft of government emails from Microsoft‚Äôs servers  and its recent  supply-chain hack of the Treasury Department . Commerce and the General Services Administration have 270 days to develop guidelines for key protection, which would then have to become requirements for cloud vendors within 60 days. To protect federal agencies from attacks that rely on flaws in internet-of-things gadgets, the order sets a January 4, 2027, deadline for agencies to purchase only consumer IoT devices that carry the newly launched  US Cyber Trust Mark label . Another part of the order boosts CISA‚Äôs ability to watch for cyberattacks across the government by tapping into the security software that other agencies operate. It‚Äôs an attempt to reduce visibility gaps that adversaries have successfully exploited in many intrusions, especially  the 2020 SolarWinds hack . The order requires agencies to give CISA direct access to their security platforms and to allow CISA to conduct unannounced threat-hunting activities on their networks. ‚ÄúIf we find one particular technique that a foreign government is using to hack one particular federal agency,‚Äù Neuberger said, ‚Äúthis now ‚Ä¶ gives CISA centralized visibility to hunt across all agency systems to ensure we're defending against this attack broadly.‚Äù The security risks and opportunities of AI play a major role in the executive order. The document directs the departments of Energy and Homeland Security to launch a pilot program to use AI to help protect energy infrastructure, with the goal of automating things like vulnerability detection and patching. The Defense Department would have to launch a program to use ‚Äúadvanced AI models‚Äù for cyber defense. Biden also wants DHS, Commerce, and the National Science Foundation to prioritize research on topics like how humans and AI tools can coordinate to analyze cyber threat data, how to ensure the security of AI-generated code, how to design secure AI models, and how to prevent and recover from cyber incidents involving AI systems. Biden‚Äôs order attempts to expedite agencies‚Äô use of digital identity documents to streamline citizen services and reduce waste and fraud. The directive asks agencies to ‚Äúconsider accepting digital identity documents‚Äù as proof of eligibility for public benefits. Commerce would have 270 days to issue guidance to help agencies do so. Other provisions in the executive order require government recommendations for securing open-source software; updates to cyber requirements in contracts for space systems; contracting changes to ensure that new technology supports  post-quantum cryptography ; and the use of encryption in DNS technologies, email systems, and voice and video conferencing platforms. There is also a provision requiring OMB to help agencies reduce risks associated with concentration in the IT market‚Äî a not-so-veiled shot at Microsoft . The order also lowers the bar for the government to be able to sanction people who launch cyberattacks on US critical infrastructure, potentially easing barriers to deploying one of Washington‚Äôs favorite responses to major hacks.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-ai-and-more/"},

Trump has also  pardoned or commuted the sentence  of every single person that took part in the violent insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. Meanwhile, his close ally Elon Musk has invigorated an even more extreme wing of Trump‚Äôs supporters, by  making a Nazi-like salute  onstage‚Äîtwice‚Äîin front of thousands of people in DC and millions watching on TV. Trump‚Äôs actions have generated a lot of excitement among the far-right in the US. They‚Äôve also been hailed as a blueprint by an adoring fan base of far-right lawmakers, extremist influencers, and white supremacist groups across the globe. And those people and organizations now believe that Trump‚Äôs actions should not only be copied, but taken to the next level. ‚ÄúIt is more than just a political success,‚Äù Martin Sellner, the far-right activist and leader of the Identitarian Movement of Austria, wrote on his Telegram channel. ‚ÄúIt is a metapolitical victory: the end of wokeness and trans ideology, stopping illegal immigration and many other ideas have been normalized in society.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese extremists think that this is the way to go, that their countries need to take a lesson from what Trump is proposing, and they need to not get weak about it, and not let woke activists get in their way, because everybody knows that the right thing to do is get rid of the immigrants,‚Äù Wendy Via, the CEO of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, tells WIRED. Sellner, who once  communicated with the Christchurch massacre shooter , is best known for popularizing the white nationalist concept of ‚Äúremigration,‚Äù the idea to ethnically cleanse western nations of all nonwhite citizens. That extremist ideology has gained traction among other far-right groups in Europe, including  Alternative for Germany  (AfD) and the Freedom Party of Austria. Trump even  promoted ‚Äúremigration‚Äù in September . Now, Sellner believes that Trump‚Äôs return to the Oval Office signals a moment to take his agenda mainstream. ‚ÄúBy pushing further into the realm of the ‚Äòunspeakable‚Äô we move out of the defensive and truly shift the Overton Window to the right for the first time,‚Äù Sellner wrote. ‚ÄúEven if you think Trumpism goes far enough, you should support the radical flank.‚Äù Sellner is not alone in Europe. Across the continent, far-right figures praised Trump‚Äôs actions on migration and gender, and called for leaders in their own countries to follow suit. In France, the Generation Identity group, the youth wing of the far-right Identitarian movement, wrote on Telegram: ‚ÄúRemigration in full swing. Identitarianism has won ideologically, it will only take time for this victory to be reflected in the material world.‚Äù In Ireland, Keith Woods, the far-right influencer and  ally of US white supremacist Nick Fuentes , shared a clip of Musk‚Äôs Nazi-like salute with the caption: ‚ÄúOk maybe woke really is dead.‚Äù Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who has aligned himself with Ireland‚Äôs far-right community in recent years, was in the Capitol for the inauguration and met with House speaker Mike Johnson. McGregor praised Trump‚Äôs immigration policies and wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúIreland and its human trafficking racket needs absolute dismantling! It is a breach of our security and our sovereignty. For me it is A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.‚Äù (McGregor has recently said that he is considering running for president in Ireland, which is a symbolic role without any real power.) In the UK, Tommy Robinson, whose  legal bills are now being footed by Elon Musk , wrote that Trump‚Äôs inauguration signaled that ‚Äúfreedom is back‚Äù and hailed the ‚Äúreturn of the king.‚Äù Robinson, who is currently in jail for making repeated false allegations against a Syrian refugee, which led to death threats against their family, is a well-known Islamophobic activist and former member of the fascist British National Party. Robinson‚Äôs compatriot Mark Collet, who heads up the white supremacist Patriotic Alternative group, praised the pardoning of the January 6 prisoners, writing on Telegram: ‚ÄúWhat a first day, this is a massive redemption arc.‚Äù In Brazil, far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who was invited to the inauguration but could not travel because of his alleged role in a Brazilian coup attempt in 2023, wrote a lengthy message to Trump, saying that ‚Äúunder Trump‚Äôs leadership, the West is being reborn.‚Äù He added that Trump‚Äôs return ‚Äúreaffirms the pillars of our civilization: God, nation, family, and freedom.‚Äù In Germany, Sebastian Schmidtke, the leader of the neo-Nazi Die Heimat party, wrote, ‚ÄúGreetings back from Germany @elonmusk‚Äù above a clip on X of Musk‚Äôs Nazi-like salute. The country‚Äôs far-right publication COMPACT also praised  Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization , citing the organization‚Äôs ‚Äúevil nature during the Corona period.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is huge support for Trump in the German far-right, and they see themselves emboldened by it,‚Äù Miro Dittrich, a researcher who focuses on German extremist groups, tells WIRED. Dittrich analyzed the links shared in thousands of German-speaking far-right and conspiracy-driven Telegram channels, and found that they had a strong focus on Trump, Musk, and the US inauguration as compared to the upcoming German elections. In Australia, neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell shared a picture of himself making a similar salute to Musk‚Äôs, writing on X: ‚ÄúDonald Trump, White Power, Patriots are in control.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the vision they have for the world, and Trump is their hero at the moment,‚Äù says Via.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/global-far-right-celebrating-trump/"},

And while some have noted that this version of DOGE moves away from the  sweeping vision of deregulation outlined  in a November Wall Street Journal op-ed, it's a move that will give centibillionaire Elon Musk and his allies seemingly unprecedented insight across the government and access to troves of federal data. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a clever way of integrating DOGE into the federal government that I think will work, in the sense of giving it a platform for surveillance and recommendations,‚Äù says Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University. Soon after his election victory, Trump announced that  he would form DOGE , led by Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, to  provide  ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúadvice and guidance from outside the government‚Äù‚Äîsomething that would generally require it be formed as a federal advisory committee. The idea was that DOGE would provide recommendations for how to cut some $2 trillion from the federal budget. (Shortly before Trump‚Äôs inauguration,  Ramaswamy exited the DOGE project .) Both Ramaswamy and Musk supported Trump during his campaign, but Musk emerged as one of the president‚Äôs most important financial backers, donating close to  $200 million  to the Trump-supporting America PAC. Additionally, he used the power of his own celebrity to drum up support for Trump both online and off,  joining the president on the campaign trail  and  amplifying Trump's messaging on X , the social media platform he owns. Almost immediately after the election, Musk began to take a central role in the transition, joining Trump on calls with foreign leaders and making staffing recommendations. Meanwhile, Musk  put out a call for people to work with DOGE onlin , and turned the  Washington, DC office of his company SpaceX into a staging ground for the entity  while bringing in other major figures from Silicon Valley to assist in the effort. Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen apparently joined the effort as a self-proclaimed ‚Äú unpaid intern. ‚Äù But under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, committees of the sort DOGE seemed to be shaping up to be have several legal requirements, including making all meetings publicly accessible and requiring a diversity of perspectives on the committee itself. By repurposing the USDS, which was already part of the Office of Management and Budget, Trump managed to skirt both the requirements of a formal advisory committee and the congressional oversight required when creating a new federal agency. In short, it meant DOGE would get more access to sensitive data than an advisory committee would likely have, while offering less transparency. The USDS was created by former president Barack Obama to  untangle dysfunctional or failing technology across the federal government  in the wake of the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The Service‚Äôs mandate allows it the wide-ranging ability to enter any government agency and access its software or technical systems with the goal of helping to streamline or reform existing systems. Under the executive order, DOGE teams, which ‚Äúwill typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney‚Äù will be dispatched to various agencies. They will be granted ‚Äúaccess to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,‚Äù ostensibly with the goal of streamlining data sharing across federal agencies. A former USDS employee who spoke to WIRED who was granted anonymity to preserve their privacy called the repurposing of the Digital Service an ‚ÄúA+ bureaucratic jiujitsu move.‚Äù But, they say, they‚Äôre concerned that DOGE‚Äôs access to sensitive information could be used to do more than just streamline government operations. ‚ÄúIs this technical talent going to be pointed toward using data from the federal government to track down opponents?‚Äù they ask. ‚ÄúTo track down particular populations of interest to this administration for the purposes of either targeting them or singling them out or whatever it might end up being?‚Äù Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee with the US Digital Services or another government agency impacted by DOGE? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at  vittoria_elliott@wired.com  or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal. It appears, however, that the  first order of DOGE  is to weed out people in agencies that might push back on the Trump administration‚Äôs agenda,  starting with existing USDS staff , and  hire new people . ‚ÄúDOGE teams have a lawyer, an HR director, and an engineer. If you were looking to identify functions to cut, people to cut, having an HR director there and having a lawyer say ‚Äòhere's what we're allowed to do or not do‚Äô would be one way that you would facilitate that,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, noting that DOGE‚Äôs potential access to federal employee data could put ‚Äúthem in some sort of crosshairs to be fired.‚Äù When Musk took over Twitter, he brought in outside help from his  close circle as well as his other companies  to transform the company, a  move he appears to be repeating . Who exactly is going to be part of DOGE is a particularly thorny issue, because there are technically two DOGEs. One is the permanent organization, the revamped USDS‚Äînow the US DOGE Service. The other is a temporary organization, with a termination date of July 4, 2026. Creating this organization means the temporary DOGE can operate under a special set of rules. It can sequester employees from other parts of the government and can accept people  who want to work for the government as volunteers . Temporary organizations can also hire what are known as special government employees‚Äîexperts in a given field who can bypass the rigors of the regular federal hiring processes. They‚Äôre also not subject to the same transparency requirements as other government employees. In the best-case scenario, this would allow DOGE to move quickly to address issues and fast-track necessary talent, as well as build systems that make government services more seamless by facilitating the flow of information and data. But in the worst case, this could mean less transparency around the interests of people working on important government projects, while enabling possible surveillance. ‚ÄúI think part of the reason they're wanting to use special government employees is because so long as they all work less than 60 days, the financial reporting requirements are less, which is going to be attractive to billionaires who have a lot of financial things they don't want to disclose,‚Äù says Nick Bednar, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. ‚ÄúAnd with agency approval, these individuals are allowed to continue contracting with the federal government if they represent, say, a corporation that has a lot of contracts with the government.‚Äù Musk alone has over  received billions of dollars  via contracts with the federal government through his company SpaceX. ‚ÄúTo me, [the temporary organization] suggests there's some sort of, there's some reason for that which probably has to do with skirting disclosure and conflicts of interest requirements,‚Äù claims Moynihan. Noah Kunin, former infrastructure director at the US General Services Administration, tells WIRED that ‚Äúthe government has access to incredible amounts of sensitive or proprietary business information that [businesses] had to share with the government in order to get a contract or take some action.‚Äù And while not everyone gets to access this‚Äîit generally requires some form of clearance, and government employees are not supposed to share it‚Äîthis kind of information could be particularly useful to someone like Musk or other members of the business community who might be brought into DOGE. ‚ÄúYou always have concerns whenever you have private sector individuals entering government for a temporary position,‚Äù says Bednar. ‚ÄúThis is how regulatory capture occurs.‚Äù Even with all these special maneuvers, DOGE will likely still face hurdles. Sharing data across government departments and systems is tricky, particularly when different laws govern different agencies and the information they collect. Similarly, sensitive data often requires some form of government authorization, which DOGE volunteers and employees might not be able to get. ‚ÄúThere are legal restrictions to sharing data between organizations, and those agreements take an enormous amount of effort to put into place,‚Äù the former USDS employee says. ‚ÄúThere are tons of examples of obstacles to information sharing like that. So maybe this is more aspirational than it is possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúDOGE has just sort of added this element of unpredictability to what happens next in government,‚Äù says Moynihan. ‚ÄúIt could be a bipartisan effort to make government technology work better. It could be an oligarch extracting resources from the government. We just really don't know. We're all gazing at tea leaves right now.‚Äù Updated 1/24/2024, 12:26 pm EST: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons why a source was granted anonymity.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk/"},

Fisher and her husband were both lifelong Republicans and supporters of Trump. Holding a spiral notebook, Carolyn‚Äôs 16-year-old, who uses the pronouns he and they, made a case against voting for Trump. ‚ÄúHe laid out why a vote for Donald Trump was voting against him as our child and why Donald Trump should never be president. He had literally been keeping notes of everything Trump and other Republicans had been saying about trans and nonbinary people, how they were mentally delusional and mentally ill. When he laid all of that out, my husband and I, we both just looked at each other and started crying.‚Äù Fisher, together with members of the Rainbow Youth Project, contacted the parents of the other children who were part of the pact. The Fishers later voted for then-vice president Kamala Harris, even going so far as taking a picture of their ballot to show their child. But Trump still won, and during the president‚Äôs inauguration speech on January 20, the Fishers heard him say that their child effectively doesn‚Äôt exist when he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, calls for the ending of trans care, requires housing trans women in male prisons, and allows only male or female markers on official documents like passports and not the ‚ÄúX‚Äù that was introduced in 2021 for people who identify as nonbinary, intersex, or gender nonconforming. ‚ÄúAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,‚Äù Trump said. When a bishop at the National Cathedral service for the inauguration this week asked Trump to protect ‚Äúgay, lesbian, and transgender children‚Äù the president dismissed her pleas in a Truth Social post and called her ‚Äúnasty in tone, and not compelling or smart.‚Äù The executive order contains provisions that require further federal action to become law, and this document should be viewed as a roadmap the Trump administration has drafted to signal what new rules they are planning on implementing. But experts say the order published this week, in conjunction with Trump‚Äôs very public comments, are designed to strike fear into the trans community. ‚ÄúI think there's a huge amount of it that is just about fear, and a part of it is trying to scare people into compliance‚Äù Allison Chapman, a trans rights activist, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúEnforcement takes a lot of time, energy, and resources, so what we really need people to do is to not voluntarily comply in advance. There needs to be an active resistance to these things.‚Äù The Rainbow Youth Project, an organization focused on helping young LGBTQ+ people, received over 6,000 calls in just the first couple of days after Trump‚Äôs November election win. That‚Äôs up from the usual 3,600 calls a month. It didn‚Äôt stop: The hotline received over 8,000 calls in December. Now, after Trump‚Äôs comment and actions on the first day of his presidency, the group‚Äôs crisis helpline is once again receiving a torrent of calls. Sixty-two percent of incoming calls this week, the group tells WIRED, are from trans and gender-nonconforming adolescents age 14 to 17. The callers are expressing varying degrees of emotional and mental distress, often expressing feelings of hopelessness and fear. One of the most common sentiments shared is ‚Äúmy country does not want me to exist.‚Äù While the Trump administration‚Äôs actions are causing huge distress for the trans community and their families, a stark increase in the attacks, both online and offline, are already coming from Trump supporters who feel emboldened. ‚ÄúWe have already seen an uptick in the hate against us,‚Äù Fisher says. ‚ÄúWe had someone who came to our home just last Tuesday and put a note in our mailbox that said: ‚ÄòHe's your daddy now, he's your president. You people won't exist anymore.‚Äô So yes, they're definitely emboldened.‚Äù A trans pride flag they had hanging on their porch has been stolen twice in the space of a week. At her local Piggly Wiggly, a supermarket, she overheard people at an adjacent table talking about how glad they were that Trump had ‚Äúgotten rid of‚Äù trans people. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt get rid of them, they‚Äôre always going to exist‚Äîbut he damn so put a target on them, especially my teenage son,‚Äù Fisher said. And the attacks are also targeting the groups who are trying to help the LGBTQ+ community. ‚ÄúWe have seen a lot more hate,‚Äù Lance Preston, executive director of the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúWe've been receiving a lot of messages, crazy shit, like ‚ÄòTrump is your president, now all of you are gonna have to go away. We don't want you here.‚Äô We get those in contact submission forms every day, and since the election it has just grown exponentially. It's really sad.‚Äù Some activists are also concerned that those who have always stood with the LGBTQ+ community could be too scared to speak up under Trump‚Äôs new administration. ‚ÄúEvery time something like this happens we notice supporters backing down and just getting quiet,‚Äù Chris Sederburg, who helps trans and gender nonconforming people through the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúNot all of them, but a lot of them do because they're scared of what's happening. They're scared of what might happen to them or they might catch hate for it.‚Äù Sederburg, a trans man who works as a trucker, communicates with young trans people on social media and says that the response this week from the community has been one of ‚Äúintense, immediate fear.‚Äù For Jamie Anderson, a 40-year-old teacher living in Texas, her biggest fear is that Trump‚Äôs administration forces her 15-year-old daughter Dawn, who came out as trans last year, to make a traumatic decision. ‚ÄúMy biggest worry is that she's going to have to go back to living a lie, like not being who she is meant to be,‚Äù says Anderson. ‚ÄúShe's happy now, she's a lot happier than she was right before she came out. She was super depressed. We had no idea what was going on. And finally she comes out, and she's this whole brand-new, amazing, loving child.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not Dawn‚Äôs biggest fear. When WIRED asked what that would be, Dawn remained silent. Moments after the interview, Dawn sent a message: ‚ÄúI am afraid the government will take me away and end up killing me because I am transgender,‚Äù adding that she was now willing to share this in case ‚Äúit might help others understand what I‚Äôm going through.‚Äù (Jamie and Dawn are not the women‚Äôs real names. WIRED is using pseudonyms to protect their identities.) The Fishers, meanwhile, are considering moving to a different state, possibly to California, where they feel their child would be more protected. But Carolyn Fisher worries about other families and trans and nonbinary children who may not have that option. ‚ÄúI just want these kids to know that there are people out there, even Republicans, even conservative Christians, who love them and accept them for the way they are, and we want them to stay here with us,‚Äù Fisher says.

But WIRED reporting shows that Musk‚Äôs influence extends even further, and into an even more consequential government agency. Sources within the federal government tell WIRED that the highest ranks of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)‚Äîessentially the human resources function for the entire federal government‚Äîare now controlled by people with connections to Musk and to the tech industry. Among them is a person who, according to an online r√©sum√©, was set to start college last fall. Scott Kupor, a managing partner at the powerful investment firm Andreessen Horowitz,  stands as Trump‚Äôs nominee to run the OPM . But already in place, according to sources, are a variety of people who seem ready to carry out Musk‚Äôs mission of cutting staff and disrupting the government. Amanda Scales is, as has been reported, the new chief of staff at the OPM. She formerly worked in talent for xAI, Musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company, according to her LinkedIn. Before that, she was part of the talent and operations team at Human Capital, a venture firm with investments in the defense tech startup Anduril and the political betting platform Kalshi; before that, she worked for years at Uber. Her placement in this key role, experts believe, seems part of a broader pattern of the traditionally apolitical OPM being converted to use as a political tool. ‚ÄúI don't think it's alarmist to say there's a much more sophisticated plan to monitor and enforce loyalty than there was in the first term,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at  vittoria_elliott@wired.com  or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal. Sources say that Riccardo Biasini, formerly an engineer at Tesla and most recently director of operations for the Las Vegas Loop at the Boring Company, Musk‚Äôs tunnel-building operation, is also at the OPM as a senior adviser to the director. (Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company, is  rumored to be advising  Musk on cuts to be made via DOGE and was integral in Musk‚Äôs gutting of Twitter, now X, after his takeover of the company in 2022.) According to the same sources, other people at the top of the new OPM food chain include two people with apparent software engineering backgrounds, whom WIRED is not naming because of their ages. One, a senior adviser to the director, is a 21-year-old whose online r√©sum√© touts his work for Palantir, the government contractor and analytics firm cofounded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who is its chair. (The former CEO of PayPal and a longtime Musk associate, Thiel is a Trump supporter who helped bankroll the 2022 Senate campaign of his prot√©g√©, Vice President JD Vance.) The other, who reports directly to Scales, graduated from high school in 2024, according to a mirrored copy of an online r√©sum√© and his high school‚Äôs student magazine; he lists jobs as a camp counselor and a bicycle mechanic among his professional experiences, as well as a summer role at Neuralink, Musk‚Äôs brain-computer interface company. Among the new highers-up at the OPM is Noah Peters, an attorney whose LinkedIn boasts of his work in litigation representing the National Rifle Association and who has written for right-wing outlets like the  Daily Caller  and the  Federalist ; he is also now a senior adviser to the director. According to metadata associated with a file on the OPM website, Peters authored a  January 27 memo  that went out under acting OPM director Charles Ezell‚Äôs name describing how the department would be implementing one of Trump‚Äôs executive orders,  ‚ÄúRestoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce.‚Äù  This has to do with what‚Äôs sometimes known as  Schedule F ‚Äîa plan to recategorize many civil service jobs as political appointees, meaning they would be tied to the specific agenda of an administration rather than viewed as career government workers. The order would essentially allow for certain career civil servants to be removed in favor of Trump loyalists by classifying them as political appointees, a key part of the Project 2025 plan for remaking the government. ‚ÄúI think on the tech side, the concern is potentially the use of AI to try and engage in large-scale searches of people's job descriptions to try and identify who would be identified for Schedule F reclassification,‚Äù says Moynihan. Other top political appointees include McLaurine Pinover, a former communications director for Republican congressman Joe Wilson and deputy communications director for Republican congressman Michael McCaul, and Joanna Wischer, a Trump campaign speechwriter. ‚ÄúOPM is not a very politicized organization,‚Äù says Steven Kelman, a professor emeritus at Harvard‚Äôs John F. Kennedy School of Government. ‚ÄúMy guess is that typically, in the past, there have been only one or maybe two political appointees in all of OPM. All the rest are career. So this seems like a very political heavy presence in an organization that is not very political.‚Äù Another  OPM memo , concerning the government‚Äôs new return-to-office mandate, appears, according to metadata, also to have been authored by someone other than Ezell: James Sherk, previously at the America First Policy Institute and author of an  op-ed  advocating for the president to be able to fire bureaucrats. Formerly a special assistant to the president during Trump‚Äôs first term, he is now a part of the  White House Domestic Policy Council . The return-to-office policy, according to the November  Wall Street Journal op-ed  authored by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is explicitly geared toward forcing the attrition of federal employees. Last week, many federal workers received test emails from the email address  HR@opm.gov . In a lawsuit filed last night,  plaintiffs allege  that a new email list started by the Trump administration may be compromising the data of federal employees. ‚ÄúAt a broadest level, the concern is that technologists are playing a role to monitor employees and to target those who will be downsized,‚Äù says Moynihan. ‚ÄúIt is difficult in the federal government to actually evaluate who is performing well or performing poorly. So doing it on some sort of mass automated scale where you think using some sort of data analysis or AI would automate that process, I think, is an invitation to make errors.‚Äù Last week, federal employees across the government received emails encouraging them to turn in colleagues who they believed to be working on diversity, equity, inclusion, and access initiatives (DEIA) to the OPM via the email address DEIAtruth@opm.gov. ‚ÄúThis reminded me,‚Äù says Kelman, ‚Äúof the Soviet Stalinism of turning in your friends to the government.‚Äù The OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the people whom sources say now sit atop the bureaucracy. ‚ÄúI am not an alarmist person,‚Äù says Kelman. ‚ÄúI do think that some of the things being described here are very troubling.‚Äù Tim Marchman contributed reporting.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-office-personnel-management-opm-neuralink-x-boring-stalin/"},

Just like Musk did  when he took over  the social media platform, Trump‚Äôs team is attempting to drastically reduce the number of government staffers and ensure those who remain are loyal to the president‚Äôs agenda. On Tuesday, federal employees received an email that mirrors the ‚ÄúFork in the Road‚Äù missive sent to Twitter (now X) staff shortly after Musk bought the company in 2022. The email asks federal workers to resign by February 6 if they do not wish to return to the office five days a week and commit to a culture of excellence. Those who choose to resign will continue to get pay and benefits until September, according to the memo. ‚ÄúThe federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,‚Äù reads the email, which was  later published  on the US Office of Personnel Management website. ‚ÄúEmployees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.‚Äù The news comes as Musk‚Äôs minions  take over  the US Office of Personnel Management, which acts as a human resources department for the federal workforce. Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The Office of Personnel Management also did not respond to a request for comment. Musk and his advisors, including Trump‚Äôs newly appointed  AI and crypto czar David Sacks , used a remarkably similar strategy at Twitter. About a week after the acquisition was complete, Musk laid off half the workforce. Sacks helped advise him on which teams and people would be cut. About two weeks later, remaining employees received an email with the subject line ‚ÄúA Fork in the Road.‚Äù Musk said that they would need to be ‚Äúextremely hardcore‚Äù in order to realize his vision for Twitter 2.0. This meant ‚Äúworking long hours at high intensity.‚Äù He noted that \"only exceptional performance‚Äù would receive ‚Äúa passing grade.\" Employees were asked to opt into this vision via a web form. Anyone who failed to do so by the following day would receive three months severance, Musk said. Thousands of Twitter employees would later sue, arguing that they were not paid their full severance. Musk ultimately  was able to get the suit dismissed . ‚ÄúWe are all shaking our heads in disbelief at how familiar this all feels,‚Äù says Yao Yue, a former principal engineer at Twitter. ‚ÄúExcept, the federal government and its employees have specific laws in terms of spending, hiring, and firing.‚Äù In this case, federal employees are being asked to send an email with the word ‚ÄúResign‚Äù in the subject line in the next 10 days. ‚ÄúPurging the federal government of dedicated career civil servants will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,‚Äù Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, said in a  statement . ‚ÄúThis offer should not be viewed as voluntary. Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration's goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.‚Äù In the wake of Musk‚Äôs ultimatum at Twitter, hundreds of employees resigned‚Äîmany more than Musk had expected, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The move caused widespread chaos inside the company as Musk‚Äôs lieutenants scrambled to figure out who simply hadn‚Äôt filled out the form yet and who was actually leaving the company. In some cases, Twitter employees who had quit were later called and asked to reconsider staying. One former Twitter employee noted that the OPM letter appears slightly more buttoned up than the version they received years ago. ‚ÄúClearly this was more thought out and went through lawyers unlike what they did with Twitter employees,‚Äù says a former engineering manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they do not want to incur Musk‚Äôs wrath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sickened to even be part of the connection honestly.‚Äù The latest email from the Office of Personnel Management stresses that federal employees must return to the office five days a week, though some may be asked to move to new locations due to ‚Äúmeaningful consolidation and divestitures‚Äù of existing buildings. Musk has spoken repeatedly about his distaste for working from home‚Äî a practice he has called  ‚Äúmorally wrong.‚Äù At Twitter, he told workers during an all hands meeting shortly after buying the company that if they could physically make it to an office and chose not to show up, their ‚Äúresignation‚Äù would be accepted. Under former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, employees had been told they could work remotely forever. On Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (which encompasses  Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE) sent a memo abruptly freezing all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government. ‚ÄúFederal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,‚Äù the memo read,  according to NBC News . This approach to spending‚Äîwhere a budget starts at zero, and employees have to justify every expense‚Äîis called ‚Äúzero based budgeting,‚Äù and it too is a popular Musk tactic. On Tuesday, a subreddit for federal employees was inundated with comments from people discussing the email. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust this email, there is no guarantee they will pay you, and they most likely won‚Äôt!‚Äù wrote one user. ‚ÄúLook at what happened to Twitter employees.‚Äù", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-twitter-playbook-federal-government/"},

Some, like tradwife TikTok darling Nara Smith, were predictable,  while others were less so . But what was clear was that MAGA culture, and the fashion and aesthetics associated with it, were becoming increasingly mainstream. Inauguration weekend, with its mix of parties and formal events,  brought together the who‚Äôs who of right-wing players . Observing the proceedings was Derek Guy, known online as @dieworkwear‚Äîa longtime menswear enthusiast and writer who has came to prominence as an influencer on X for his hot and unnervingly well-informed takes on the sartorial choices of everyone from Donald Trump to Andrew Tate, and what they might be telling us about this political moment. WIRED spoke with Guy after Monday‚Äôs inauguration ceremony to get his takes on MAGA fashion, what it says about who the party is for, and what the richest men alive are wearing these days. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: First, give us the reviews of the inauguration suits and ties. What are we looking at here? These are some of the richest men in the world, but I‚Äôm not sure they really look like it. Derek Guy:  You can break up the inauguration almost by age. The older someone is, the more likely they are at least avoiding the worst of what we're seeing. And the younger someone is, the more likely they are wearing something that looks cheap, because tailoring as a craft has mostly died in this country. Many people shop ready-to-wear. And when you're very wealthy, you are probably just buying a luxury-level off-the-rack suit. And just because something is made with fine materials doesn't necessarily mean it fits. So you have a market system that makes it difficult to find a good suit. If you're younger, like Mark Zuckerberg's age, you're more likely to kind of fall into this short-jacket silhouette that you think looks modern and hip but frankly looks really dated and makes you actually look more middle-aged, like someone who learned how to dress in the early 2000s. Vivek [Ramaswamy], for example, wears really shrunken suits. Jeff Bezos often wears pretty good tailoring but today wore a very short jacket which did not look very good on him. He looked surprisingly bad today, given how he looks in tailored clothing other times. Elon Musk, I'm pretty sure he wears a Tom Ford suit, because that's five buttons on the cuffs. I thought it looked pretty good on him, but he looked bad at the rally last night. He was wearing a short overcoat with gray jeans, and it didn‚Äôt flatter him very well. The outfit didn‚Äôt make much sense. Zuckerberg, his suits are neither fantastic nor horrible. Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, they are still clearly nerds who don‚Äôt care about clothes. But, you know, for example, JD Vance has a custom tailor. He has a 90-year-old Italian tailor in Ohio. That guy is not following fashion trends. Why do the rank-and-file MAGA enthusiasts favor such slim-fit suits when Trump himself often wears things that are quite baggy? What you're seeing is young conservatives will often wear very shrunken suits because they care more about the tailored aesthetic. Ironically, you actually look better if you're the kind of young Democrat who doesn't care about aesthetics at all. So then you wear a sloppy suit. You still look bad, but you essentially avoid the shrunken look. The MAGA aesthetic will change over time as conservatives change their tastes naturally. But I mean, just to be frank about it, many conservatives are often behind on fashion trends. We are at this moment where the large part of the market has shifted away from the shrunken look of the early 2000s. But if you're kind of behind on fashion trends, you still think that looks good. Are you seeing changes to the hallmarks of the MAGA aesthetic, particularly as we're seeing it merge a bit with the quiet luxury vibe that became very popular online? MAGA is a very populist aesthetic, so it's intentionally vulgar and thumbing its nose at WASP morality and aesthetics, even though within the Republican Party there is still that kind of celebration of bourgeois 1950s aesthetics. I often like to contrast it. When Ronald Reagan and George Bush were first inaugurated in 1980, the Republican Party commissioned custom blazer buttons commemorating their inauguration, and they gave them out for free to attendees at the various events surrounding the inauguration. So if you attended Reagan's inauguration in 1980, you would have gotten a brass button commemorating the inauguration, made by Ben Silver in Charleston, South Carolina. It was presumed that people who attended Reagan's inauguration would have a navy tailored jacket. And if you put brass buttons on a navy jacket then that jacket becomes a blazer. It was presumed that not only would young Republicans have a navy jacket, but that they would want to wear a blazer with a button commemorating Reagan's victory. The merchandise surrounding Trump's movement is gold sneakers and Never Surrender T-shirts and, of course, the red MAGA hat. To me, this demonstrates the schism between the classic Republican‚Äîwhich is the Brooks Brothers, free-trade, globalist, Reaganite Republican‚Äîand the new Republican, which is populist. They pay reverence to Reagan, but they don't share his politics. The aesthetic is very much not the classic WASP aesthetic, which used to be the Republican aesthetic. Trump's own aesthetic comes from the 1980s‚Äîthe ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù of Wall Street boom times. He wears very padded shoulders and a power tie. He used to wear a banker collar, but no longer. And that's very different from the demure look of Brooks Brothers WASP. MAGA is a very aggressive, populist ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the establishment aesthetic. When you think about the MAGA aesthetic, are there particular brands or influencers who come to mind for you? It's all very campaign merch, and the most mainstream item is just the MAGA hat. It still seems very much like campaign merch. I don't think there's anyone else that sets the tone except for Trump. There are certain people that embody that look very well. Forgiato Blow, he has that kind of very loud aesthetic. There was a moment where Viper sunglasses were very popular, which was, I think, driven by Baked Alaska. So there are microtrends in that universe. But it‚Äôs really Trump‚Äîwhatever he releases next, people will wear. Do you think that sort of classic American look‚Äîthe Ralph Lauren, the oxford shirt‚Äîis that going to be sort of the purview of MAGA forever, or do you see that changing? I don't think the classic American aesthetic is strictly MAGA, though. I think a Brooks Brothers look is like the ABC of menswear; that's like a very classic American tailored look. In the postwar period, right after the end of the Second World War, there was a culture clash between establishment lifestyle‚Äìthe man in a gray flannel suit who works in a corporate job and has a conventional kind of nuclear family and white-picket-fence house‚Äîand the counterculture. That was this kind of liberal side of the political spectrum. They wore work wear and chambray shirts, hippie gear, motorcycle jackets. That all became counterculture. But if you go back further than that, everyone wore tailored clothing, from criminals to CEOs to liberals and Republicans. Ralph Lauren could not have built his empire if button-down shirts and penny loafers were exclusively conservative attire. I think it's interesting that the current status of Republican politics is trying to unite the Brooks Brothers aesthetic with the gold sneakers. Do you see them coming together? I think that's the weird dichotomy at the moment, because the MAGA movement and Republicans in general have always been kind of looking back toward some idea of America. Even though not every man wore a suit in the 1950s, the suit has historically been associated with the kind of bourgeois lifestyle. And a lot of conservatism in general is about upholding bourgeois lifestyles, morality, identity, politics, and so forth. There is now a populist section of the Republican Party that's not about Reaganism or Bush. It's very about Trump. And its aesthetic is very different from what William Buckley would have worn. William Buckley would not have worn gold sneakers. I think they are distinct and contradictory, but people can hold contradictory ideas in their head. We are in an age where politics is very tribal. And so long as it fits the narrative of our tribe, then I think it's coherent for that group. For Republicans, I think those two very contradictory aesthetics are just now within the party. The men of tech are new to the MAGA crowd, but many people have noted a significant change in their looks, particularly Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs. Can you talk about what they‚Äôre trying to signal and to whom? I heard through the grapevine within my industry that [Elon Musk] used to have a stylist. I don‚Äôt think he has a stylist anymore. Mark Zuckerberg denies having a stylist, but I don‚Äôt believe him. He is certainly going through a style transformation in the last year and three months, I would say. Jeff Bezos most obviously has a stylist. I don't think what they're doing has anything to do with politics. I think Jeff Bezos went through a style makeover after his divorce. And I suspect Mark Zuckerberg just got tired of dressing like a college student. Elon has clearly given up on his stylist and doesn‚Äôt dress very well. [Zuckerberg] dresses more like an MMA guy. He is wearing the boxy tees and the gold chain. But he looks like someone who updated his look to be trendier. There are a lot of guys wearing that kind of silhouette and gold chain, and I don‚Äôt know that that says anything about their politics. We saw a lot of the sort of ‚Äúspaghetti Western‚Äù vibe happening. What‚Äôs your take on that? As a fashion trend, the Western look really leans more liberal, right now, because it‚Äôs popular in big cities. Conservatives now dress like metrosexuals in the early 2000s, and liberals dress like Bush-era conservatives. Conservatives are in slim-tight suits or slim-fit suits, and then liberals are like Carhartt double-knees, Western shirts, cowboy boots. There is some of this inherently on the right because it's a Midwestern look. But Elon Musk does wear cowboy boots pretty frequently, as does Jeff Bezos.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/menswear-guy-maga-tight-suits-gold-sneakers/"},

Now, after being sentenced to life in prison and spending more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht will walk free, thanks to Donald Trump‚Äîand to the president‚Äôs  ever-closer ties to the American cryptocurrency world . ‚ÄúI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,‚Äù president Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, misspelling Ulbricht's last name. ‚ÄúThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!‚Äù For close to two and a half years after Ulbricht created the Silk Road in 2011, the dark-web site facilitated the sale of vast amounts of narcotics, as well as counterfeit documents, money laundering services and, at times, guns, for hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin payments. After the FBI located the Silk Road‚Äôs server in Iceland in 2013 and arrested then 29-year-old Ulbricht in San Francisco, he was convicted on seven charges relating to the distribution of narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, as well as a ‚Äúcontinuing criminal enterprise‚Äù statute‚Äîsometimes known as the ‚Äúkingpin statute‚Äù‚Äîusually reserved for mob bosses and cartel leaders. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison, a punishment beyond even the 20-plus years that prosecutors in the case requested. Since then, a Free Ross movement has steadily pressed for Ulbricht‚Äôs release, first in a failed appeal, then in petitions for clemency. Many of Ulbricht‚Äôs supporters have long argued that the Silk Road was a principled libertarian experiment in free trade, one in which Ulbricht allowed only ‚Äúvictimless crime‚Äù‚Äîdespite prosecutors arguing during his trial that at least six people died of opioid overdoses from drugs linked to the Silk Road. They point out that Ulbricht never actually sold or possessed drugs himself, and rather ran a website that facilitated their sale. And they argue that by moving the sale of narcotics online, he reduced violence in the drug trade and committed no violence himself. The Untold Story of Silk Road, Part 1 By  Joshuah Bearman That argument has been complicated, however, by  allegations that Ulbricht tried to have six people killed  who presented a threat to him or the Silk Road. Ultimately all six alleged murders-for-hire were fake‚Äîone was staged by undercover DEA agents and five more were a scam. Ulbricht was charged with only one of those alleged paid killings in a separate prosecution in Maryland, which was then dropped after he received a life sentence in his New York trial. But  evidence presented at Ulbricht‚Äôs trial  showed him allegedly arranging those killings and even pinpointed transactions on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain that showed a payment for them from Ulbricht‚Äôs laptop to the would-be killer. Those allegations of murders-for-hire, in fact, dissuaded the first Trump administration from granting clemency to Ulbricht. The White House in 2020 considered freeing Ulbricht but ultimately rejected the idea because of the alleged role of violence in the case, according to one former government official involved in the process who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity. Since then, however, the Trump administration has shifted its stance on Ulbricht‚Äôs case‚Äîin part, perhaps, due to its embrace of the libertarian cryptocurrency community, for whom Ulbricht has become a martyr and cause c√©l√®bre. At the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, last May, then presidential candidate Trump  promised to commute Ulbricht‚Äôs sentence  ‚Äúon day one‚Äù if reelected. (Ultimately, day one passed with no clemency for Ulbricht, even as  Trump pardoned more than a thousand participants  in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, though Trump ally Elon Musk promised in a  post to X  on Monday evening that ‚ÄúRoss will be freed too.‚Äù) Just what role Ulbricht will play in the free world is far from clear. Even in his statement to the judge at his sentencing hearing in 2015, Ulbricht never fully acknowledged the harm inflicted by the Silk Road‚Äôs drug sales. And according to Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a former Homeland Security Investigations agent who infiltrated the Silk Road during the investigation, Ulbricht still shows little remorse for his actions in his public posts to X. ‚ÄúThe idea of him being released doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least,‚Äù says Der-Yeghiayan, who now works as the head of strategic intelligence at cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis. ‚ÄúI do get bothered if there‚Äôs now a perception that he did nothing wrong; that doesn‚Äôt acknowledge the facts of the case.‚Äù Among some advocates of criminal justice reform, however, Ulbricht has become an exemplar of oversentencing, particularly given that he was technically charged with nonviolent crimes. ‚ÄúRoss has served more than enough time. He has been a model prisoner. He‚Äôs a first-time, nonviolent offender. He poses zero safety risk to the community,‚Äù Alice Johnson, CEO of the justice reform foundation Taking Action for Good, told WIRED in November. Johnson spent two decades in prison herself for attempted possession with intent to distribute before Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 and pardoned her in 2020. ‚ÄúI believe that Ross‚Äô case is going to pave the way for many others who have been unjustly given these draconian sentences to come home.‚Äù On Tuesday night, Ulbricht's supporters celebrated his freedom and voiced their gratitude to Trump for his clemency. ‚ÄúWords cannot express how grateful we are,‚Äù reads a tweet from @Free_Ross, an X account devoted to the more than decade-long effort on Ulbricht's behalf. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is a man of his word and he just saved Ross's life. ROSS IS A FREE MAN!!!!!\" Additional reporting by  Joel Khalili", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-frees-silk-road-creator-ross-ulbricht-after-11-years-in-prison/"},

The 29-year-old cofounder of the  Atomwaffen Division , a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization that was responsible for five homicides and a number of bomb plots before the  FBI dismantled it in 2020 , Russell was  arrested  by federal agents in February 2023 along with his girlfriend, Sarah Clendaniel. If convicted of his charges of conspiring to destroy an energy facility, Russell could face 20 years behind bars thanks to a prior conviction and the potential penalty for his current charges. Russell‚Äôs case represents one of the last gasps of the Biden administration‚Äôs hard-charging approach to tackling violent far-right extremism that is all but guaranteed to change during US president Donald Trump‚Äôs second term in office. It also offers a unique look inside federal law enforcement‚Äôs investigation into an insidious accelerationist propaganda network that mixes neo-Nazi ideology with nihilist, Columbine-style violence to inspire mass casualty events in the United States and beyond. Russell allegedly hatched the plot to black out Baltimore while, according to prosecutors,  participating  in a noxious, prolific propaganda network hellbent on fomenting violence and chaos. The  Terrorgram Collective , which took its name following a massive influx of neo-Nazis to Telegram at the end of the last decade, ran several channels on the messaging‚Äã‚Äã app and developed a series of ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù domestic terrorism manuals that sought to inspire disaffected young men and women into committing mass casualty events. Terrorgram is currently designated a ‚Äútier one‚Äù extremism threat by the US Department of Justice. To date, Terrorgram has released four publications‚Äîa blend of ideological motivation, mass-murder worship, neofascist indoctrination, and how-to manuals for chemical weapons attacks, infrastructure sabotage, and ethnic cleansing.  Court records  indicate there are at least three unreleased Terrorgram Collective compendiums, including ‚ÄúThe Saint Encyclopedia‚Äù of the far-right mass killers they venerate, including Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Timothy McVeigh; and ‚ÄúThe List,‚Äù a collection of politicians, government officials, business leaders, journalists, activists, and other people deemed legitimate assassination targets. The screeds appear to have directly inspired a series of ideologically motivated attacks around the world, including a 2022  mass shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia , successful attacks on power infrastructure in North Carolina and similar failed plots in Baltimore and New Jersey, and a stabbing spree in the Turkish city of Eskisehir. There are currently more than a dozen separate federal prosecutions around the United States that involve people alleged to be core Terrorgram Collective members or individuals allegedly inspired toward violent attacks on infrastructure or civilians. In one of the Biden administration‚Äôs last policy moves against right-wing extremism, on January 13, the State Department  formally classified the Terrorgram Collective as a Foreign Terrorist Organization , a listing usually reserved for militant groups that hold territory and have a formal real-world paramilitary structure as opposed to a loose propaganda network that seeks to inspire mass casualty events. While it is not unique‚Äîthe British Home Office  formally proscribed  Terrorgram as an extremist organization last May, and Russell‚Äôs Atomwaffen Division was banned by the UK, Australia, and Canada‚Äîit is likely to be the last such action taken toward neo-Nazi groups by the United States government for the foreseeable future. The Trump administration appears to be engaged in a wholesale shift away from violent far-right extremism, best illustrated by the  unprecedented pardons  given to more than 1,500 individuals charged or convicted of crimes during the failed insurrection of January 6, 2021, as well as the reassignment of senior Justice Department attorneys in the National Security Division. In a set of  pretrial hearings and motions  over the limits of evidence in Russell‚Äôs trial, federal prosecutors convinced US District Court judge James K. Bredar to allow in evidence of Russell‚Äôs deep neo-Nazi indoctrination, including background about his founding role in the Atomwaffen Division. Russell‚Äôs alleged involvement in the Terrorgram Collective is bolstered by a pendant allegedly recovered by FBI agents in a search of his home after his February 2023 arrest: The necklace is made of swastika-bearing beads that contains a larger golden swastika pendant with ‚ÄúTerrorgram‚Äù inscribed along the side. The court is taking extra precautions as the US attempts to convict Russell. Journalists‚Äô use of phones and laptops in the courtroom is forbidden, and the judge granted some witnesses permission to testify anonymously over fears of retaliation by Russell's compatriots, some of whom have indicated in Terrorgram chats cited in  court filings  that they have sought to identify informants and agents involved in their cases. Clendaniel, Russell‚Äôs girlfriend,  pleaded guilty in May  and was later sentenced to 18 years in federal prison. It is unclear whether she will be one of the witnesses testifying against Russell. The prosecution of Russell also offers insight to how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies collaborate with their foreign counterparts to combat the transnational far-right milieu that spawned the Terrorgram Collective. In an unusual alliance over the past two years, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs National Security Project weighed in on Russell‚Äôs behalf during pretrial motions in an effort to reveal  evidence of warrantless surveillance  of the fascist figurehead by either the National Security Agency or its counterparts. Although Judge Bredar ultimately denied the ACLU‚Äôs efforts on the grounds that the material was classified, the government‚Äôs response spoke volumes about the intelligence community‚Äôs role in surveilling Russell. American intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED show the Five Eyes alliance of American, Canadian, British, Australian and New Zealander intelligence agencies were keeping tabs on the Terrorgram Collective as far back as 2021. The presence of Terrorgram Collective members in Croatia, Denmark, Slovakia, South Africa, Canada, and elsewhere overseas, coupled with the State Department‚Äôs designation of the propaganda network as a foreign terrorist organization, also point to additional reasons the group would be subjected to the highest level of official surveillance. Russell was on court supervision when he was picked up for the Baltimore plot nearly two years ago. In 2018, he was convicted on federal charges for possession of homemade hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, a highly unstable compound. He served a little over three years in prison and was released in August 2021. Russell‚Äôs arrest, in 2017, on illegal explosives charges,  stemmed from  a macabre internecine squabble within the Atomwaffen Division and a  double homicide  at the Tampa, Florida, apartment Russell shared with three other extremist comrades.
