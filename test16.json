That’s according to its developer, UK startup Phasecraft.    The Bristol- and London-based company describes the breakthrough as the largest single leap in quantum simulations to date — moving us a step closer to real-world quantum applications.   Quantum computers improve on classical simulations by accurately modelling complex quantum behaviours — like the ever-changing interactions between molecules or the evolution of materials over time — that are too difficult for classical computers to simulate efficiently.    This could lead to technological leaps in various fields, from energy to manufacturing and medicine. For example, quantum computers could simulate materials in a battery far more accurately than ever before, enabling scientists to  design materials  that store energy more efficiently, last longer, and charge faster.

Phasecraft’s new  algorithm , called THRIFT, promises to accelerate the process. By optimising quantum simulation, THRIFT enables scientists to model new materials and chemicals faster and more accurately, even on today’s slow machines.   In tests, THRIFT improved simulation estimates for a key benchmark in quantum physics — the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model — by a factor of 10. The advance enables simulations that are 10 times larger and can run 10 times longer than those produced by standard methods. The findings were published in  Nature Communications  today.   “We’ve managed to show a 10x increase on today’s machines, and we’d expect this to only get better as the hardware advances and quantum computers become better at tolerating errors and handling more complex calculations,”  Raul Santos, Phasecraft’s lead quantum scientist, told TNW.   The future of quantum simulations   In the last year or so, the obscure world of quantum computing has emerged from the lab and entered the public domain — fuelled by Big Tech’s  recent progress  in quantum processors. In the past few months alone, Google launched a chip called  Willow,  Microsoft unveiled  Majorana,  and Amazon revealed  Ocelot.    Advances in quantum computing are only good news for Phasecraft. “This algorithm enhances efficiency on near-term devices, like those Google and Microsoft have announced,” said Santos. “Any improvements in their performance can only enhance our approach.”    Rather than waiting for years or even decades for quantum hardware to mature sufficiently, Phasecraft is redesigning a lgorithms to work on today’s imperfect quantum machines.     Phasecraft was founded in 2019 by professors Ashley Montanaro (CEO), Toby Cubitt (CTO), and John Morton (director). The company spun out of the University of Bristol and UCL. The  startup , which has raised over $20mn to date, works with leading quantum hardware companies, including Google, IBM, and QuEra.

SAP’s shares rose 1.6% on Monday, bringing its market cap to €313bn. That was just enough to nudge Danish weight loss drugmaker Novo off the top spot.    SAP’s stock has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid booming demand for its AI-driven enterprise resource planning software (ERP). The cloud-based software centralises business data, allowing multiple departments to access and share information in one place.   In contrast, Novo is having a tougher time on the stock market. Novo’s flagship product is Ozempic, a  weight loss drug  championed by celebrities and the ultra-wealthy, including  Elon Musk . However, trials of the firm’s newest weight loss therapy,  CagriSema, haven’t generated the same excitement.

Check It Out                       Novo isn’t the only company feeling the impact of SAP’s stock rally. In October, the software firm rode overtook ASML to become Europe’s most valuable  tech  company.    ASML, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, makes chip-making equipment for most of the world’s largest semiconductor companies. As the only firm that manufactures the EUV lithography machines required to produce the world’s most advanced computer chips, the Dutch business has become an investor darling.    However, ASML’s shares  plummeted dramatically  in in October, wiping €50bn off its market cap in one fell swoop.    The plunge came after the Dutch firm said it did not receive the expected number of orders for its lithography machines and expects fewer net sales for 2025 than previously estimated.    That news also sparked a  global sell-off  on chip stocks, as investors worried that demand may be faltering. However,  analysts  were quick to point out that weak orders at ASML were more a sign that chipmakers had been stockpiling chips than a longer-term problem.    Since then, ASML’s stock has soared, plunged, and risen again. In January,  shares jumped  as much as 12% — the largest increase in nearly five years —  following a surge in order bookings. The company currently ranks as Europe’s fourth most valuable, with Paris-based LVMH in third place behind SAP and Novo.    The shifting fortunes of Europe’s biggest companies reflect the volatility of today’s global markets.

Indeed, innovation has always been crucial in conflict. Armour made knights safe until the crossbow came along. High walls protected cities until cannons emerged. Trenches were made obsolete by fast-moving mechanised forces. The lesson: a military that cannot innovate is one that falls behind.    Yet Europe remains stuck with an outdated model of defence procurement – one that favours a handful of bloated contractors doing the same old thing over the fresh ideas of startups and entrepreneurs. Against a backdrop of serious geopolitical unrest and diplomatic realignment, this must change.   The gap between the US and Europe in defence innovation is striking. At least 25% of US defence contracts go to small firms – startups and specialist companies that are building the future technology of conflict. This is not an accident. The US government has deliberately nurtured an environment where defence innovation thrives.    The key to its success is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an institution that backs risky but potentially transformative projects, and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), which helps the military adopt emerging innovations. Their projects have also had enormous impacts on civilian technologies. It was DARPA funding, for instance, that led to the first self-driving cars. Many engineers participated in a DARPA challenge offering prize money to teams that could develop autonomous vehicles capable of navigating difficult terrains without human intervention. This led to  the launch of Waymo , an autonomous vehicle company now worth £35bn.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       Europe, in contrast, remains wedded to an antiquated system. In the UK, a handful of defence contractors dominate government procurement, leaving little space for disruptive newcomers in critical fields like  advanced materials . Across the continent, defence startups are treated as speculative ventures rather than essential contributors to national security. The result is an industry that moves too slowly, costs too much, and lacks the dynamism required for modern warfare. Add to this a regional cultural reluctance among private investors to put money into defence, and you have a problem.    It’s ironic that this culture, deliberately fostered after two World Wars to avoid inter-European conflict, is now becoming a barrier to protecting Europe from harm. In other words, the world’s greatest peace project is now threatened by its failure to take the steps needed to become conflict-ready.   Europe needs a new ecosystem for defence tech   Nowhere is the cost of our complacency clearer than in Ukraine. There, war has been reshaped by innovation. Small, nimble startups have built  the inexpensive drones  that are taking out enemy tanks worth millions. Engineers fresh out of university are programming weapons that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. This is the nature of modern warfare: high-tech, decentralised, and led by those who can iterate and adapt the fastest.    I have personally stressed to policymakers in my native Germany that failing to support new technology risks not just stagnation but also a very dangerous dependency on a few suppliers. Those suppliers could dictate terms or withhold critical resources in times of crisis.   Europe needs to rethink its defence industrial strategy from the ground up – and then get moving. The first step is joint procurement. A fragmented defence market, in which every country insists on having its own suppliers and favours its own national champions only weakens Europe as a whole. We have a multitude of  incompatible weapon systems  because of this. By putting in place a baseline standard for joint procurement, Europe could create a defence ecosystem that is more competitive, more cost-effective, and more resilient.   Secondly, supply chains must be diversified and scrutinised. The war in Ukraine has exposed just how vulnerable Europe’s supply networks are to disruption; a continent that cannot reliably produce and distribute the materials it needs in wartime is a continent that has already lost the fight. Ensuring a steady and secure flow of critical resources should be a priority, not an afterthought. There are serious gaps in our supply chains. These must be closed — fast.   We must back entrepreneurs   European governments must also change the way they think about procurement. Startups cannot flourish if they are locked out of big contracts from the outset. Governments must follow the US model: fund bold ideas, take calculated risks, and support innovators  before  they prove themselves at scale.    Defence innovation does not happen in boardrooms of established firms. It happens in the labs and workshops of those willing to challenge the status quo. The financial risk of backing these young, hungry entrepreneurs is dwarfed by the threats to security that can arise from neglecting them.   European investments in defence startups are absolutely vital, and I choose that word deliberately. Nowadays, a single drone can cripple a convoy. A well-placed electronic warfare tool can render an air-defence system useless. A targeted electromagnetic pulse (EMP) detonated over the continent could blackout Europe overnight. AI-driven jamming can blind enemy satellites. These technologies are shaping the future of warfare. They exist now, and they are increasingly accessible.    In short, the conflicts of the future will not be won by those with the largest armies, but by those with the best technology, the quickest decision-making, and the most adaptable systems. European governments are already behind the competition. If they do not act now, they may find themselves permanently so.   It is time for Europe to recognise what the US has understood for decades: innovation wins wars. And innovation starts with those who dare to disrupt.

Among their explanations are stiff competition,  overspending , allegations of  mismanagement , and a lack of state support.     Northvolt may be bankrupt, but the fight for a strong European battery ecosystem is far from over. That’s the consensus from several tech investors and startups we’ve spoken to in recent weeks.   Creating a  sustainable  and competitive battery value chain in  Europe , though, will be littered with challenges. One of them — competition from the East — may be insurmountable. TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                         The continent faces two clear options: collaborate with Asia’s industry giants or build a stronghold in the next frontier of battery tech.   China looms large   Northvolt set its sights on capturing 25% of Europe’s battery market by 2030, hoping to wrestle supply away from Chinese and South Korean companies. Together, these two nations  supplied  Europe with 90% of its batteries last year.   While Northvolt faltered — failing to meet its targets and losing key clients — Chinese battery firms forged one deal after another with European automakers. Notable among them were Gotion’s partnership with Volkswagen and CATL’s joint venture with Stellantis to build a €4.1bn lithium battery factory in Spain.   Asian battery manufacturers have been steadily expanding their reach into European  startups , too. Gotion acquired a 25% stake in Slovakia’s InoBat in 2023. Founded in 2019, the battery startup has raised $400mn to date, with Gotion a major backer.    “While Gotion and InoBat pursue very different strategies and are fully independent, InoBat has benefited from Gotion’s long track record, experience and know-how, helping to avoid fatal mistakes,” InoBat’s CEO and co-founder  Marian Bocek tells TNW.    Gotion and InoBat have formed a joint venture to build a €1.2bn lithium-ion battery plant in Slovakia, slated for completion in 2027. The batteries will be destined for EVs and electric aircraft.    InoBat is building a smaller gigafactory in Slovakia to produce batteries for high-performance EVs, with testing already underway for European automakers, including Ferrari.   British solid-state battery firm Ilika is another European hopeful taking advantage of China’s battery superiority.  Graeme Purdy, t he company’s CEO, cited a lack of “Asian partnerships” as one potential reason for Northvolt’s downfall. “ Global cooperation offers the strongest path to commercial success,” he tells TNW.     Ilika is shipping its first samples to 17 automakers this year, the company said. Instead of building a gigafactory, the UK-based outfit plans to license its technology to other companies. Ilika has a long-standing research partnership with Japanese automotive giant Toyota.   For European startups, the appeal of partnering with East Asian battery makers is obvious. They have the tech, scale, and supply chain efficiency that Europe lacks.    However, that reliance comes with risks.    Opportunities and threats   The dependence on Chinese companies has sparked several concerns. Trade  disputes, geopolitical tensions, or sudden export restrictions could send battery supply chains into chaos or even sever existing agreements, leaving European firms scrambling for alternatives.    Tom Johnstone, interim chair of Northvolt, has called on European politicians to invest heavily in local battery startups instead. “There’s a cost to pay for it, but there can be a bigger cost to pay for not doing it,” he told the  Financial Times . He hopes Europe  will “use the foundation” that Northvolt had provided to establish its own competitive battery industry.   A Northvolt gigafactory in Sweden’s icy north made Europe’s first domestically produced lithium-ion battery in 2021. Credit: Northvolt   Northvolt’s operations in Sweden are now up for sale. Volkswagen, Scania, and Volvo are all potential buyers, while some  experts believe  a Chinese company will acquire the business.     Either way,  Danijel Višević, partner and co-founder at Europe’s largest climate tech VC, World Fund, thinks European startups should focus their attention on cornering the market for next-generation battery chemistries, not lithium-ion cells.   “When it comes to  lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries , China has won,” he says. “Northvolt should have realised that earlier — they moved to new innovative materials too late.”    Recharging Europe’s battery sector   Louis Fearn, principal at InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover, argues that Europe ought to shift its strategy. “The way forward for Europe will be to focus not on challenging China, but on securing domestic supplies of raw materials and exploring frontier technologies.”   Europe’s emerging battery players could do well to bet on the next frontier of battery tech where the playing field is still open.   Kevin Brundish, CEO of Dutch battery maker LionVolt, agrees. He’s adamant that Europe’s expertise in next-generation battery tech is keeping “the dream of battery sovereignty within grasp”.    “Our robust ecosystem of startups and scale-ups is already pioneering breakthrough technologies in silicon and lithium-metal anodes — innovations essential for next-generation high-performance batteries,” Brundish tells TNW.   LionVolt spun out from TNO’s Holst Centre in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 2020. The startup is working on a 3D  lithium-metal anode  that improves energy transfer in lithium-ion, sodium-ion and, in the future, solid-state batteries.     LionVolt is one of an emerging cohort of startups looking to disrupt the status quo of battery manufacturing. LeydenJar, also from Eindhoven, makes  silicon anodes  that can store up to 10 times more energy than traditional graphite anodes used in lithium-ion batteries.    Cambridge University spinoff Molyon has developed a  lithium-sulfur battery  that  it claims delivers twice the energy density of lithium-ion. Sweden’s Enerpoly is building a factory that makes  zinc-ion batteries  for energy storage, which doesn’t rely on supplies of lithium. Netherlands-based CarbonX is developing alternative anode materials that could help wean Europe off  China-controlled  graphite.    While most of these startups are focusing on subcomponents, there may also be a place for bigger players.    A route to battery independence   France’s Verkor was arguably the only European contender to Northvolt. Backed by Renault, Verkor has secured €3bn for a 16 GWh gigafactory in Dunkirk, set  to  produce batteries for 300,000 EVs annually when completed around 2028.    “Europe can build an end-to-end value chain for batteries; in fact, it has to —  batteries are vital components of both climate and defence technologies on which our sovereignty depends ,” says  Višević.    For that, Europe will need to invest, otherwise its battery ambitions could end up going the way of Northvolt. That will require venture capital but also significant public funding.     InoBat’s Bocek says that Europe needs to give automakers an incentive to buy local batteries, just like it did with feed-in tariffs for renewable energies a decade ago.  “Financial support and fast-tracking of permitting is essential,” he says.     Northvolt’s fall is a cautionary tale, but not the end of the road. If Europe wants battery sovereignty, it must act decisively, pouring funds where they’re needed most. While foreign powers like China will no doubt form part of Europe’s battery future for a while to come, the smartest move for Europe might not be to play catch up but to carve its own niche.     Europe’s technological sovereignty will be a hot topic at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Now, it has teamed up with Patria to trial the tech on the defence firm’s armoured vehicles.   The partners will jointly develop a heads-up display for Patria’s six-wheel drive  armoured personnel carrier.  The system will display 3D tactical data, terrain mapping, and AI-driven military insights directly onto the windshield,   allowing military personnel to see in low-visibility environments like darkness and smoke.    The MR technology promises to eliminate the need for additional screens or clunky headsets. The display also remains covert, preventing light leakage that could reveal vehicle positions, Distance said.   Urho Konttori, the startup’s CEO and co-founder, claims it will give drivers “super sensing abilities.”   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       “Creating XR heads-up displays that visualise mission-critical information on the windshield offers unprecedented speed, confidence, and decision-making ability on the battlefields of the future,” said Konttori, the former CTO of Varjo, another Helsinki-based XR startup.   Unlike standard heads-up displays in cars, which project static or pre-determined information onto the windshield, Distance’s technology tracks the user’s eye movements and then displays the correct light field to match where they are looking.   The “brain” behind the system is so-called contextual AI,  a type of  artificial intelligence  that understands and reacts based on its situation.   Distance can add its light field optics on top of most LCDs. When users look through the screen, they see a  computer-generated 3D light field mixed in with the real world.  This means  virtually any transparent surface can transform into an MR window — whether that’s the windshield of a car, an F-18 fighter jet, or a 6×6 armoured vehicle.

Credit: Distance Technology Oy and Patria   Distance  claims the system is capable of “infinite” pixel depth, which means it should  be indistinguishable from natural sight.  Konttori no doubt drew inspiration from his work at Varjo, which in 2023 unveiled the world’s first  retina-resolution XR headset .    The MR model for Distance   Konttori left Varjo early last year.  “I’ve started increasingly feeling that it’s time for me to move on,” he said in a LinkedIn post at the time. “I’m leaving Varjo and starting something new. Not anything Varjo does… but pretty mind-blowing.”   Distance is that new venture. The company indeed takes a very different approach from  his former employer  While Varjo develops headsets with lenses, Distance offers glasses-free XR tech to the automotive, aerospace, and defence markets.   In July last year, the startup emerged from stealth with a $2.7mn pre-seed investment. Three months later, it  raised $11.1mn  in a round led by  Google  Ventures. Now the company is looking to test its  tech  in the real world.     Distance’s collaboration with Patria is part of the defence firm’s government-funded eALLIANCE program, which seeks to support Finnish civil and defence tech companies.      The partnership comes as Europe rushes to increase defence spending amid cooling relations with the US. Just yesterday, Germany  voted  to create a massive  €500bn ($545bn) fund for defence and infrastructure.

The company launches with a central mission: empowering non-technical founders to quickly create high-quality Minimum Viable Products (MVPs).   To bring their plans to life,  Skylark  has created an AI-enhanced framework that promises rapid, efficient iteration cycles. Freelance  developers  apply the framework to build the MVP. While they code, Skylark’s internal team handles the client acquisition.   Every solution is customised for the founder’s objectives. By drawing from a pool of freelancers, Skylark can then find developers that fit each project’s specific needs.    The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! The MVPs are designed to scale in the real world. Throughout the build, Skylark provides founders with strategic insights and expert support.   “We help them launch faster, cheaper, and better than traditional agencies,” Steven Kleinveld, the startup’s CEO and co-founder, told TNW. “And we do that mainly due to our framework.”   Kleinveld has strong links to TNW. He recently completed an internship as a startup scout at  TNW Programs , which he credits with kickstarting his plans for Skylark. He has also chosen  TNW City  for Skylark’s headquarters.    From the Amsterdam office, he’s developed a roadmap to quickly deliver MVPs.   The process begins with an assessment of the client’s needs and goals. After setting out the deliverables and timelines, Skylark analyses the market and competition to refine the project plan. Developers then build a flexible, code-based prototype.    Finally, the prototype is refined into a polished MVP. Clients also receive the full codebase — and advice on how to use it. Additionally, Skylark offers further guidance on features, design, SEO, and strategy.   The plans aim to solve common problems for non-technical founders.

Credit: Skylark   Technical issues for founders   Many of the world’s most successful  startups  had non-technical founders, from Pinterest’s Ben Silbermann and Airbnb’s Brian Chesky to Tinder’s Whitney Wolfe Herd and Snap’s Evan Spiegel. But there could have been many more. Countless big ideas never become big businesses, because the minds behind them are short on  coding  skills.   Kleinveld has first-hand experience of the issues. While studying business at the University of Amsterdam, he attempted to code his own projects.   “I’m not overly technical, and it took me months to build not even MVPs, but just apps. And it frustrated me, because I had so many ideas,” he said.   He discovered that many other entrepreneurs experienced similar problems. One common issue was that lengthy development cycles led them to miss the ideal time for market entry. Another was lacking the technical expertise to evaluate and collaborate with developers.   Skylark aims to resolve these problems.    Key to the plans is an array of AI enhancements to the development process. Among them are the app builder Lovable — one of Europe’s  fastest-growing startups  — the code builder Cursor, and the versatile ChatGPT Pro.   By blending AI with a product delivery framework and a pool of developers, Skylark hopes to give flight to a new flock of founders.  As Kleinveld puts it: “If the idea is stuck on the ground, we launch it into the sky.”   Whether you’re a non-technical founder or a coding genius, this summer’s  TNW Conference  will offer numerous insights on building successful startups.

The likes of Slack, Wise, Bolt, and Trello all made their mark on our stage before becoming global brands. Visionary leaders from Google, Meta, and Reddit have joined them to share the strategies behind their success, while star speakers  Edward Snowden , will.i.am, and  Lila Ibrahim  have explored the frontiers of innovation.    On June 19-20, we will return to the iconic NDSM venue in Amsterdam with a renewed focus on our founding mission: elevating the startups and scaleups that will change the world. Today, we’re unveiling the next stage of that journey — our sparkling  new agenda  for TNW Conference 2025.   Filled with bright minds and bold ideas, the agenda is divided into  three key themes : Next in Tech, Growth & Venture, and Enterprise Innovation. We’re also introducing a new edition of  the Assembly , an exclusive gathering of policymakers and business leaders, and bringing back  TECH5  — the “Champions League of Technology.”   3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

Startups, scaleups, investors, corporate innovators, and governments will all find a variety of sessions that can boost their businesses.   To bring the agenda to life, we’ve assembled a powerhouse collection of speakers. Here’s a small taste of the lineup:     Vidya Peters, CEO of  DataSnipper , the Netherlands’ fastest-growing tech company   Jyoti Hirani-Driver, COO of NATO’s DIANA, a new defense tech accelerator for the military alliance   Pernilla Sjöholm, a survivor of the “Tinder Swindler” and now an advocate for fraud awareness   Daniel Gebler, co-founder and CTO of Picnic, the leading online supermarket in the Netherlands   Jeroen van Glabbeek, CEO of CM.com, a global leader in cloud software   Ali Niknam, CEO and founder of Bunq, Europe’s second-largest neobank     The dynamic agenda has been crafted by our expert events team, ably supported by the TNW Advisory Board of tech leaders. Leading the charge is Oliviana Bailey, TNW’s Head of Content.    “The global landscape is shifting, and European tech founders are at the forefront — both championing and challenging Europe to seize the moment,” Oliviana says.    “This year at TNW Conference, I’m eager to hear from founders, policymakers, and corporate innovators on how Europe can assert its leadership in deep tech and defense, shaping a more competitive future.”   Expect a mix of bright minds, sharp insights, bold ideas, and a healthy dose of controversy.   Let’s dig into a few highlights.   Next in Tech   At Next in Tech, a stellar squad of innovators and industry leaders will dive into the biggest breakthroughs on the horizon.   Healthcare expert Lucien Engelen will sound the alarm on employee well-being in  Code Red: Why the Future of Work is the Future of Health.  On a lighter note, viral comedy sensation Derek Mitchell — creator of  @letsdoubledutch  — will bring his razor-sharp wit to the stage.   Other unmissable sessions include:     Quantum Race: Can Europe Secure Leadership in Quantum?   The Aftermath: Deepfakes, Disinformation, and Disruption in Democracy   Where is Iron Man? Why Tech Needs to be in Defense   The AI Revolution in Filmmaking: Are We Ready for What’s Next?     Next in Tech is a major draw for Victoria Slivkoff, a TNW Advisory Board member.    As the Executive Managing Director at program partner  Extreme Tech Challenge  and the Head of Ecosystem at  Walden Catalyst Ventures , Slivkoff keeps a close eye on disruptive innovations. Our agenda’s focus on emerging trends in AI immediately caught her attention.   “NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang highlighted that AI can now ‘process, reason, plan, and act,’ requiring significantly more computing power,” she says.   “This shift presents opportunities and challenges for deep tech startups, particularly in semiconductors and AI. These innovators must develop solutions supporting advanced processing capabilities while addressing energy efficiency and technological sovereignty.”    Growth & Venture   The startup world is changing fast. That’s why TNW’s Growth & Venture track will reexamine traditional investment models — and ask if it’s time for a shake-up.   Expect hot takes in sessions such as  Off with Their Heads: Death to the VC & Building Smarter Investment Models . But don’t worry; we’ve been assured that actual executions are not on the agenda.   European competitiveness will be another big topic for discussion. We’ll explore future paths to growth at  Death of the Unicorn: Can Europe Learn to Love Rapid Growth?  and  The State of European Deep Tech.   A session that’s caught the eye of Andy Lürling, a founding partner at VC firm  Lumo Labs  and a TNW Advisory Board member,   is  Getting Over the AI Buzz: Creating Truly Deep Tech Startups.    “I believe we need to harness smart brains and AI to help solve the world’s societal and environmental challenges, and in my opinion, we need to shift from curing to prevention in the healthcare sector,” he says. “AI plays a crucial role in this.”   Here are a few of the other must-see sessions:     Been There, Funded That: Founders-Turned-Investors on Picking Winners   Mastering the Exit: M&A Strategies for Startup Success   Green Growth: Funding and Scaling Businesses for a Sustainable Future   Scaling Success: Building a Performance-Driven Culture     Enterprise Innovation   Our Enterprise Innovation  sessions will deliver sharp insights on scaling tech businesses and adapting to disruption.   This track is designed to help corporate leaders supercharge their digital strategies and stay ahead of the competition.   This year, TNW is also introducing a  Corporate Innovator  ticket, providing access to an exclusive lounge where business leaders can connect with the tech pioneers reshaping industries.

You needed a database to store application data. These were slow, expensive, and unreliable, regularly bringing applications to a grinding halt when a single instance failed. You needed a server to run interpreted languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. These were equally expensive, often needed configuration, had security issues, and frequently ran out of memory or CPU resources, again bringing applications to a grinding halt.   For anyone on a small budget, running web 2.0-era applications required constant configuration tweaking, tight performance streamlining, and cost reduction, all within the typically tight confines of what a provider would even let you change and manage yourself.   Between those heady days and now, an increasing patchwork of hosting providers emerged to cope with the complexity and scale that web applications demanded.    For the past 10 years, a significant proportion of applications have moved to a new generation called “cloud hosting”. The term “cloud” is a bit vague, and there’s a popular (but not altogether accurate) phrase that says, “The cloud is just someone else’s computer”. The cloud abstracts and simplifies the complexity of managing the infrastructure mentioned above. Instead of thinking about servers, you think of services and instances of services.   In the modern infrastructure world, when a database is struggling, you add another instance.   If you have so many database and application instances that you’ve lost track of what’s happening, add another service or three for that, too.

Taking this abstraction to an extreme, “serverless” has reached its peak popularity in the past few years. This approach aims to reduce servers and services to something more like a function call. Of course, a server still handles all these function calls and responses behind the scenes, but the argument is that you shouldn’t need to worry about that and should only focus on sending and receiving data.   More than 20 years later, web-based application developers’ lives are surely easier, aren’t they?   No, not really. There are many issues with developing and maintaining apps that run in the cloud. Thankfully, several European operators are trying to make developers’ lives easier again.   Before getting to them, here’s a quick terminology guide.     Private cloud : Services used by only one customer.   Public cloud : Services shared by more than one customer.     In both cases, customer data and details remain private, and everything could run in one or more locations. The main difference is that the provider carves out a digital tranche of territory just for that customer. This is probably defined in software, but it could be in hardware, and it could be a dedicated server running remotely or locally to the customer.   With that in mind, let’s dig into the problems in the cloud computing world.   The cloud is consolidated and monopolised   Cloud computing has hundreds of providers, yet most people only think of three:  Amazon  Web Services  (AWS),  Microsoft  Azure  (Azure), and  Google  Cloud Platform (GCP) — known as the “hyperscalers” of the hosting industry.    The web is a big place, brimming with publicly and privately available sites, so precise numbers of what runs where are hard to come by. However, according to statistics from  builtwith.com , about 12% of websites — approximately 86.8 million in total — run on AWS. The other two “only” host roughly another 12% combined. If you look at hosting companies that call themselves “cloud”, then according to  techjury.net  these percentages increase to 32% for AWS, 23% for Azure, and 10% for GCP.   Yet with these statistics, defining what constitutes a website is complicated. Hyperscalers offer hundreds of different services that developers use for one or more parts of an application, some of which perform crucial functions that break an application if unavailable.   This has caused problems in the past. Remember the various times when large amounts of online services were unavailable? That was probably due to one of these major companies experiencing an outage. This has led to many developers taking a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud approach with their applications, spreading risk by hosting services across multiple providers. This solves a technical issue but brings more revenue to all cloud providers and increases complexity.   This consolidation puts a tremendous amount of power into a handful of companies. If they change their policies, thousands of businesses could be left without a place to run. More concerning is that all of the top three — in fact, all of the top five — are US companies, except for Alibaba, based in China.    The US already has  data privacy, security, and law enforcement policies  that concern many companies and jurisdictions , and while all the companies mentioned provide hosting options in a global variety of jurisdictions, what if politics in the US no longer respected these digital borders? No matter how unlikely some things can seem, consolidation is always dangerous.   Diversifying the cloud   Developers and their companies do not want to completely switch away from the cloud. Rather, they are looking for new options from the hyperscale hosts, especially in Europe, where there is a mixture of increased regulations and insecurity around using American services, alongside a degree of nationalism encouraging people to use European services.   These trends create new global opportunities for alternative hosting providers, new and old, especially in Europe.   I spoke to three of the largest hosting providers in Europe to find out if they are noticing the same trends and what they think the next 20 years of web hosting might look like. Two of them — France’s  OVH  (the host of around 4% of websites) and Germany’s  Hetzner  (around 5.5% of websites) — have existed since the late 1990s, before the web 2.0 revolution and “cloud” was a term. The third is the UK’s  Civo , which is just seven years old, but has founders with many more years of experience helping companies bring their  applications  to the internet.   European cloud providers are offering new approaches to hosting. Credit:  ccPixs.com   The cloud hasn’t lived up to its promise   As developers rushed to the cloud, it promised to make developing and running large, complex applications easier and more cost-effective. Anyone who has sat back to look at the myriad tools and processes they now have to use and maintain for a cloud-native application might wonder how true that is.  The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)  landscape map  has become so large that other tools and working groups are needed to help people navigate it.   While the hosts of yesteryear would charge a reliable and steady amount per month, hyperscale cloud companies tend to charge by usage, which leads to unpredictable and spiky costs that are often hard to interpret and act upon. A recent report from  cloudzero  states that more than 20% of respondents have no clear idea of their cloud costs, which can consist of thousands of rows of data. A  report from IT support firm AAG   found that  82% of respondents find cloud spending challenging.   The European difference   OVH, Hetzner, and Civo all said the interaction points to the hyperscalers have become overly complex, with too many layers of abstractions needed to get started. People are now accustomed to more user-friendly interfaces. If AWS arrived today with its byzantine UI, the service might struggle to attract as many users.   For Europe’s cloud competitors, this presents an opportunity. “With everything we do, we put ourselves in the shoes of a user,” said Dinesh Majrekar, CTO of Civo. “By using sensible defaults and clear cost indications, we aim to make it possible to scroll to the bottom of any form and create what you need.”   Hetzner’s approach is similar. As their spokesperson, Christian Fitz, told me, “We offer a straightforward user interface and an easy setup process, ideal for users who need cost-effective servers without complex administration.”   Cost efficiency   One of the biggest motivations in the current climate is cutting costs. The move to the cloud promised to save users money, or at the least, ensure they only spend money on resources when needed, rather than pay for idle machines. However, as the AAG report mentioned earlier shows, companies are now paying more than ever for running services. Granted, actual usage is likely also increased. For many, the issue is the inconsistent monthly bills and the lack of transparency in the relationship between services, usage, and costs.    In recognition of how big this disconnect is, there’s now an entire foundation, the  FinOps foundation , dedicated to maximising the business value of the cloud, and  OpenCost , an open-source tool that helps show the cost of infrastructure decisions,  was recently welcomed into the CNCF .   Around the time of KubeCon EU 2024, Broadcom had recently acquired VMWare and announced significant pricing changes. VMWare had been a popular option for running a private cloud, and while Broadcom rolled back some of the pricing changes, the experience caused many to look for more open and standards-based options for private cloud hosting. All three hosts emphasised the importance of allowing customers to switch between providers. The most controversial of these policies is charging for egress, i.e. the cost of moving data from a cloud service, which can make  multi-cloud  hosting prohibitively expensive.   OVH has pledged not to apply these charges. Yaniv Fdida, the company’s Chief Product and Technology Officer, said, “We have no fees on egress or traffic in and out. The cloud should be free. This enables our customers to balance workloads and have free choice. This is part of our tagline, and as far as tools are concerned, we use open standards.”   This is a growing trend amongst providers. As Majrekar notes, “We recently got rid of egress charges altogether. So that’s something you don’t have to worry about.”   A trustworthy cloud   Perhaps due to anxieties about keeping valuable data in other territories, national pride, or regulatory reasons, European companies often look to alternatives to the hyperscale hosts.   For OVH, that provides a chance to offer a more trustworthy service.   As an older company, OVH runs its own data centres but also produces a lot of its own hardware in locations in Europe and North America. The  hyperscalers make a lot  of their own hardware  too , but the only hosts I could find that make hardware in Europe are OVH and Hetzner. This creates what OVH calls the “trusted cloud”, where they can guarantee higher data sovereignty thanks to knowledge of the supply chain behind the  hardware  that processes customer data.   This doesn’t just lead to increased trust but also, as Fdida put it, an increased ability to innovate.   “Because we are not tied to any third-party suppliers, we can really accelerate our time to market and our durability and longevity,” he said.   A less wasteful cloud   While the hyperscale hosts  rush to  open power plants  to meet the high energy demands for generative AI applications, smaller hosts are taking different approaches. Sustainability is one area where European providers (and global providers’ European operations) excel and have the potential to lead the world as other regions start to pull back from sustainability commitments.   Hetzner has made the issue a key selling point. As Fitz, their spokesperson, told me, “Our commitment to environmentally friendly hosting spans many years; in Germany, we power our data centres exclusively with hydropower, and in Finland, we also use wind power. Hosting that aligns with sustainability goals is becoming increasingly important. “   Civo, meanwhile, partners with the  UK’s Deep Green  to run graphical processing units (GPUs) that many AI-heavy processes use. Deep Green uses multiple methods to reuse the heat that servers generate. For example, the company  submerges servers  in a special liquid , heating that water and using it for other purposes. While Deep Green already has 1,500 sites around the UK, it’s unclear how many of these are used by Civo.    Deep Green and Civo aren’t the only partners trying this idea in Europe. Swiss host  Infomaniak does  something similar . These projects are a great example of how Europe’s typically denser cities can use colocation.   One aspect of making sustainable data centres that is often missed is the embedded carbon in buying and decommissioning servers.  OVH has addressed this by  recycling and reusing  much of its hardware, keeping older machines running for less intensive use cases.   The future of the cloud   Looking back over nearly 30 years of web hosting, you can see many changes in demands, requirements, and ways the industry handles them. If the sudden surge in demand for new AI tools is anything to judge by, it’s hard to make predictions.   Fdida thinks the next challenge for providers will be quantum computing.   “ Quantum will drastically change the way we look at workloads,” he said. “We are a pioneer in Europe and have been delivering simulators of quantum computing in our cloud for the last two years. And we have a real one hosted in our facilities with a company. We believe that it takes time to materialise how quantum can disrupt completely because it’s a new paradigm of looking at computing, right?”   Another issue for the future will be complexity. Mark Boost of Civo hopes that moving forward will also mean a return to simpler times.   “Before the cloud, you had hosting companies, you had FTP, and you could just move between providers,” he said.   “Amazon pretty much defined this new market in the early days and has created this world of complexity, which means that freedom of movement is so difficult. I’d love to see us get to that place, and I think the future will be that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Chris Chinchilla                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Technology writer, podcaster, and video maker by day.

It also provides tools for reporting and analytics.   Earlier this month, Mews  raised  $75mn , bringing its total funding to date to $411mn, according to PitchBook data. To date, the company has acquired 12 competitors as it looks to increase its market share.   The scaleup is riding   sustained growth   in global travel to fuel its expansion. Mews reported 50% year-on-year growth in 2024, processing more than $10bn in payments volume and surpassing $200mn in revenue. Last year, the scaleup also earned unicorn status after raising $110mn at a valuation of $1.2bn.    While things are going well at Mews,  Welle feels that the Dutch government isn’t doing enough to support entrepreneurs. “There’s no plan for tech startups,” Welle said  in a recent  interview . “That is the biggest problem.”   Growing concerns over Dutch plans for startups   Welle is not the only Dutch tech leader frustrated with the lack of support for up-and-coming businesses.    Robert Vis, co-founder and CEO of Bird, announced last month that the company plans to move most of its o perations out of the Netherlands. He didn’t mince his words, either.   “Both The Hague and Brussels enjoy being in meetings and talking more than they get shit done,” Vis  told TNW , adding that EU policymakers are “killing innovation.”      Job van der Voort, CEO and founder of Remote, an HR platform valued at over $3bn, believes Europe as a whole is not doing enough to nurture the next big tech success stories.    Van der Voort also warns that  burdensome tech regulation  is encouraging moves beyond the continent. “It’s becoming unattractive to start and maintain a business here,” he told TNW last month. “That’s why I tell startups to leave Europe if they want to succeed.”   Van der Voort has followed his own advice. After he and Marcelo Lebre founded Remote in 2019, the partners decided to base the company in San Francisco. “It was simply easier to start it there,” he said.

Shrimp  Jesus. The  Titanic colliding  with an iceberg lettuce. Social media is saturated with AI slop — low-quality, often ridiculous and sometimes  disturbing  images, videos, or words created using generative artificial intelligence.    While some AI slop is glaringly fake, a lot isn’t. I remember the first time AI hoodwinked me. It was a striking video I saw on Instagram of a pair of  snowy owls  in the Arctic with a brood of six little chicks. Amazed by the scene, I instantly shared it with my wife. Her response was: “Surely that can’t be real?!”    It wasn’t. A quick review of the poster,  Yournaturescenary  — which has over 230,000 followers on the platform — revealed the video was indeed AI-generated. I felt fooled, conned, and ultimately, suspicious of every other image I saw online from that moment on.      I used to use Instagram to follow creators and share my own photographs of nature and wildlife — you know, images that I captured using an actual camera, with my actual human hands. But recently, scrolling through my feed has become less viewing pleasure and more spot-the-bot. That’s irritating, sure, but when AI images appear real they can also cause  serious harm .    All of this has forced me to seek  an alternative. It turns out, I’m not alone.  The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!   “The most frequent feedback we hear is that people are feeling overwhelmed by AI-generated images flooding mainstream platforms,” Jingna Zhang, founder of Cara, a decentralised social media app for artists, tells TNW.    But unfortunately, it’s a problem that’s likely to get a lot worse before it gets better.    Meta opens the AI floodgates   Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has  embraced  AI on its platforms, scrapped  fact-checking , and even plans to allow bots to open their  own accounts . And while Meta did start  labelling  AI-generated content last year, its algorithms have been shown to  mistakenly label real images  as bot-created ones and vice versa. The platform has also made it really easy to  disable the label .      But the cherry on the shitcake is that Meta openly uses  public posts to train its algorithms. Although  most European users can opt out, since they’re protected by data protection laws, Meta automatically opts in all user accounts by default .  Fuelled by all that free data, AI algorithms are rapidly improving —  hurting  artists and creators. It’s like learning valuable skills from a friend, using those skills to start a company together, and then cutting them out of the benefits —  ring any bells , Zuck?    AI slop, bot accounts, little to no moderation — it’s part of what writer Cory Doctorow coined the “ enshittification ” of the internet. But while many have just accepted the new reality, some creators are seeking refuge in safer corners of the internet.      Cara has been one of the beneficiaries.  When Meta announced plans to train AI models on user content last year, the app’s user base grew from 40,000 to 650,000 users in a single week.   “They [artists] have been looking for a place where they can still experience genuine human-to-human connection in art and online communities, and that’s how they found Cara,” Zhang says.    Putting artists first   Zhang argues that new rules to protect creators online are essential.   “We believe that the rampant ethical and data privacy issues around these [AI] datasets urgently need to be resolved via regulations, and governments should explicitly clarify their positions or pass bills to protect artists and all individuals from such unauthorised use,” says Zhang.    It’s a problem Zhang, who’s an award-winning Singaporean photographer, knows all too well. She  won a landmark appeal  in a Luxembourg court last year over a painter who copied one of her photographs. She’s also  suing Google  for allegedly using her photographs to train its AI model Imogen without consent, and is a plaintiff in a similar case against Midjourney, Stability AI, Runway AI, and DeviantArt.    Zhang launched Cara in 2023 as a sanctuary for artists looking to share and connect.  The volunteer-run organisation has both a website and mobile app. Like Instagram, users can host a portfolio of work on their profile, post images, engage with others through likes and comments, and build a following. They  also have a feed where they can post updates, similar to on X or BlueSky. The platform currently has 1 million users.    Cara offers a refuge for artists online. Credit: Cara   Cara’s big selling point, however, is its policies on AI. All users are automatically opted out from AI bot-scraping by default, the company tells me. Cara also doesn’t host generative AI content on the platform, and uses a combination of automated detection and human moderation to keep the site clean.    For Zhang, curbing bots on the platform isn’t just about user piracy, but also about protecting art itself. “What makes art meaningful is knowing that a real person gave time from their life to hone a craft, practice, build skills, and wanted to express themselves so much that they created something through art,” she says.    So how does it compare with Instagram? Well, my first impressions are good. The app works smoothly, has a similar layout to other social media I’ve used, and features content that’s generally of high quality. Most of all, I can relax and take off my bot-spotting glasses, knowing that all the artworks were created by humans.    However, Cara is clearly a place for artists — sketchers, painters, graphic designers, and the like — not photographers. For that, we tried another app — Pixelfed.    Not perfect, but not Instagram   Launched and run by Canadian developer Daniel Supernault, Pixelfed is an open-source, decentralised photo-sharing platform similar to Instagram but without ads or algorithms. As with Cara, AI-generated content is prohibited.    Pixelfed’s server rules upon sign up. Credit: Pixelfed   Much like Instagram, Pixelfed enables users to share and discover photos and videos, as well as send direct messages. However, the feed is chronological — posts are displayed in the exact order they were published. That’s like Instagram before 2016, when it switched to an algorithm-based feed that shows you the content it thinks you want to see.   Despite having only 700,000 users on the platform, Pixelfed already hosts plenty of great photography. It feels raw and unfiltered, and the ad-free, AI-free experience allows you to focus on the content.   Pixelfed looks a lot like Instagram, but there’s no ads or AI in sight. Credit: Pixelfed   Pixelfed runs on ActivityPub, an open protocol for social networking developed by  Tim Berners-Lee’s  World Wide Web Consortium.   ActivityPub also powers other apps like microblogging site Mastodon — founded by German developer  Eugen Rochko  — and YouTube alternative PeerTube. Together they form part of the  fediverse , a decentralised network that allows users to follow, share, and interact across different apps — similar to email working between Gmail and Outlook.     Pixelfed’s user base grew rapidly following the release of its app on iOS and Android in January. For a short while after launch, it became the  most downloaded  social app on Google Play in the US and France.    However, with Supernault the sole developer, plus the surge in traffic, there are inevitably some bugs. For one, my phone’s back button didn’t work when using the app on Android, which meant I had to reach to the top-left to use the in-app button. The app also feels a bit slow.    Supernault just raised over $90,000 through Kickstarter, so that might help him iron out some of the bugs or maybe even hire another dev or two.    But as one  Reddit  user put it: “People are moving to Pixelfed not because it’s perfect but because it’s not Instagram (I don’t think anyone needs to explain why at this point). If staying on Instagram doesn’t affect your values[,] don’t make the move.”    So long, Instagram, I’m off.

The rack-mountable machine is designed to simply slot into high-performance computing (HPC) data centres alongside standard servers.    Equal1’s CEO Jason Lynch told TNW that combining quantum technology with today’s most advanced classical processors offers the fastest route to a quantum computer capable of potentially world-changing calculations.    The potential applications are endless. Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems that classical computers cannot, which could lead to breakthroughs in drug discovery, cryptography, modelling, and AI.      The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Credit: Equal1   Equal1 marries classical transistors (for normal computing tasks) and quantum transistors (for qubits) in a single silicon-based chip. Qubits, akin to bits in a regular PC, are the basic units of information in a quantum computer. The more you have, the faster the machine.    Most quantum computing technologies are based on either  trapped-ion  or superconducting  qubits. However, Equal1’s design uses  silicon-spin qubits .    Bell-1 is noticeably smaller than most quantum computers out there. The company credits this to its  closed cycle cryo-cooler that allows the machine to operate at 0.3 Kelvin (-272.85°C) without requiring massive external dilution refrigerators.    Most quantum computers need to be kept super cool because heat causes errors by disrupting the delicate quantum states of qubits ( there are exceptions , however).     The machine’s cooling system. Credit: Equal1   For now, Bell-1 is limited to just 6 qubits, which means it’s not yet capable of solving real-world problems . For comparison, Google’s recently unveiled Willow chip has 105 qubits. However, Google’s machine isn’t available to buy — Bell-1 is.    “Tech companies are recruiting more and more quantum experts now as they explore the future possibilities of this technology,” said Lynch. “Bell-1 will help them, and others, run experiments like quantum phase estimation and error correction that will form the foundation for more powerful processors in the future.”    The chip for Bell-1. Credit: Equal1   Equal1’s quantum journey   Equal1 was founded in 2018 as a spin-off from University College Dublin. The startup currently employs about 45 people and, while still based in the Irish capital, has an expanding presence in the Netherlands — one of the world leaders in quantum technology.    The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)  recently backed Equal1 with an undisclosed  investment . Last year, the Irish company opened a research facility close to TU/Delft, an emerging hub for quantum tech startups such as  QuantWare .    By leveraging standard semiconductor manufacturing, Equal1 aims to bring quantum computing closer to real-world applications faster than its competitors. That competition pool is growing, though, and fast. In the past few months alone, Google launched quantum chip Willow, Microsoft unveiled   Majorana ,  and Amazon revealed   Ocelot .    Quantum computing is on the  new agenda  for TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Portugal’s Diogo Dalot is the latest recruit, teaming up with compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo to back personalised supplement pioneer Bioniq.   Dalot has invested €1mn in the company, which has developed an innovative approach to nutrition. Founded in 2019, Bioniq analyses blood test biomarkers to create customised supplements for athletes.   The recipes are created by an algorithm trained on over 6 million biochemical  data  points. According to Bioniq, the system can generate over 10 million combinations of nutrient granules, each tailored to the specific needs and goals of each customer.   Dalot has received his own personalised formula, which he credits for enhancing his performances on the pitch.

Shortly after, Bioniq reported that its total user base had tripled in 2024.   A fitness obsessive, Ronaldo raved about Bioniq’s physical benefits.   “It’s about aligning with a shared vision for health, performance, and longevity,” he said.   “I have been using their products myself for almost three years. With their personalised health approach, I believe Bioniq has the potential to transform how we care for our bodies and help people reach and maintain their peak performance for longer.”   Footballers fuel the tech investment boom   Dalot and Ronaldo are part of a growing wave of footballers investing in tech.   Leading the charge is France forward  Kylian Mbappé , whose investment firm, Coalition Capital, recently backed German electronics brand Loewe Technology.   Spain’s Gerard Piqué and England’s Rio Ferdinand have also made notable bets. The former Manchester United teammates scored big by investing in NFT trading card game Sorare before it soared to a $4.3bn valuation.   Perhaps the busiest investor in the lineup is Mario Götze. The German World Cup winner has backed  startups  ranging from sports media platform ScorePlay to edtech firm Junto, while also founding the investment vehicle Companion-M.   Since scoring the winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, Götze’s playing career hasn’t reached the heights once expected — but his business ventures have thrived.   For startups, the involvement of footballers offers more than just financial backing. With their fame, fanbases, and industry connections, they can provide powerful platforms for growth.

However, rendering typically requires a lot of time, effort, expertise — and money. Tools like Visoid look to disrupt the status quo.   “What started as a simple tool for architects to generate beautiful visualisations has led us on a journey to simplify and democratise the visualisation process itself,” said co-founder Joachim Holwech.   Here’s how the  software  works:    Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       You take a screenshot of your 3D design and import it into Visoid’s web-based app. Then write out a general overview of your creative vision using a text prompt — “Scandinavian house in the woods with big windows,” for example. You can also set more detailed requirements like the desired lighting or background elements. Once you’re ready, click “Render.”   Then the AI, trained on images of real buildings and homes, will generate your visualisation. If you’re happy with the result, you then download it in up to 4K resolution.    All of this speeds up the 3D rendering time by up to 90%, Visoid claims.    The  startup  also promises to slash costs.  A typical architectural  3D render costs  anywhere from €90 to €9,000 — per image. In contrast, Visoid’s Premium software package is available for just €55 a month.    The founders of US-based construction outfit PANL, one of Visoid’s clients, described the impact as “game-changing.”   “It allows us to create lots of beautiful content for a fraction of the price,” they said.   AI accelerates into architecture   PANL is far from alone in applying artificial intelligence to architecture. Over 40% of architects are now using AI tools, according to a  report  last month by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).    Some of these AI tools include OpenAI’s ChatGPT for writing briefs, and text-to-image generators like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or Dall-E for creating early concept designs. However, Visoid is confident that its tool offers something unique.    “Unlike other AI tools that generate images from prompts and light references, Visoid uses architects’ actual 3D models to create precise, true-to-design renderings,” CEO and co-founder Mark Szoke told TNW.    “While other AI tools operate with more freedom based on less information and are more relevant in generating concept ideas and variations, Visoid ensures precise control and photo-realistic visualisation — key reasons behind our rapid usage growth in just a year.”     https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/03/Visoid_beforeafter_2.mp4   Since launching in 2023, Visoid has attracted customers in over 80 countries and generated more than 2.7 million images, with over 500,000 uploaded to its platform, the company said.    The startup’s progress caught the attention of VC firm Antler, which participated in the new seed  funding  round.    “The fact that they have reached a high ARR [annual recurring revenue] and attracted users from around the world  while having spent very little money on marketing  shows they have built something that creates real value for their customers,” said Anna Munthe-Kaas, associate partner at Antler.   Antler contributed to Visoid’s new funding alongside lead investor StartupLab, a Norwegian startup incubator and investor and construction giant OBOS.    Visoid will use the fresh capital to expand its team and reach new clients.  Among the recent additions to the customer base is the Nordic Office of Architecture. One of Scandinavia’s leading architecture practices, the company has led mega projects including the new Oslo Airport and Norway’s Government Quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

Conceived in the 1960s, their unique spiked-nozzle design promises better efficiency, reusability, and performance at all altitudes. But their complexity — and the  shutdown  of major space programmes towards the end of the 20th century — meant they never entered the mainstream.    But now, startups are dusting off old designs and using new technologies to revive aerospike engines for modern spaceflight. One of these ventures is Spain’s Pangea Aerospace.   Founded in 2018, Pangea has been operating under the radar for most of its seven-year history. But today, the company announced a  €23mn Series A funding round as it looks to ramp up development of its 3D-printed aerospike rocket engine.   Among the investors was André-Hubert Roussel, former CEO of ArianeGroup, who oversaw the development of Europe’s only heavy-lift rocket in operation,  Ariane 6 . Roussel joined Pangea’s board last year.    Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       “ It’s incredibly valuable to have such a figure investing in and advising us as we embark on our next stage of growth,” Pangea’s CCO and co-founder  Xavier Llairó told TNW.    Roussel praised the company’s plans on  LinkedIn . “ Strong team, strong technology, building the future of space propulsion,” he said.   An aerospike rocket revolution?   In 2021, Pangea successfully conducted a hot-fire test of Demo-P1, the world’s first aerospike methalox engine.     “We’ve been silently making breakthroughs in  cooling techniques, additive manufacturing, and materials science that are now paying off,” said  Llairó . “We’re sure we can produce aerospike engines at a low cost.”      Pangea, which has headquarters in Barcelona, Spain and Toulouse, France, is now directing most of its focus towards ARCOS, slated to become the world’s first flight-ready aerospike engine.   ARCOS is designed to be reused up to 10 times and to power both a rocket’s booster and upper stage. And like the Demo-P1, it will be 3D-printed.   A 3D render of the finished ARCOS engine. Credit: Pangea   Pangea, in partnership with Aenium Engineering, has developed a proprietary copper-alloy material that can make an engine capable of withstanding the extreme thermal and mechanical loads of rocket launch and flight. The team has also developed a way to quickly deposit it in layers using a 3D printer.    “The result is a  very low-cost, very strong combustion chamber that can withstand the high heat and pressure,” said  Llairó . “With this technology, we’ve been able to produce things that were simply unproducible before.”   Pangea’s aerospike engines are 30% more efficient than traditional bell engines, delivering 15% higher overall efficiency, and enabling up to 30% more payload capacity to orbit, the company said in a statement.   The new space boom   Pangea aims to build rocket propulsion systems for all rocket sizes, from microlaunchers to heavy-lifters. Last year,  the European Space Agency (ESA)  contracted  the startup to design a very high-thrust rocket engine, which could power future European heavy and super-heavy rockets.     However, Pangea mainly looks to cater to the emerging flock of private  space   companies. The startup  says it  wants to be the Rolls-Royce of rockets — the leading engine supplier in the sector.   Pangea is currently testing its technology in partnership with three private space companies,  Llairó told TNW. “Two European, one American,” he said, refusing to elaborate further.    Europe’s most promising rocket launch  startups  right now include Germany’s Isar Aerospace and  Rocket Factory Augsburg  (RFA) and Spain’s  PLD Space . All three are set to blast off on their maiden flights this year, although Isar  looks to be the first . Then there are the more established European heavyweights, Arianespace, a subsidiary of ArianeGroup, and Avio, the Italian makers of  Vega-C .     All these companies are looking to tap a booming global  space economy , forecast to be worth  $1.8 trillion by 2035. For Pangea, that means more customers.    Llairó also thinks space tech offers an important strategic lever for Europe, which is pushing to ramp up its  defence capabilities  and  tech sovereignty  amid cooling relations with the US and threats from Russia.    “Space is crucial for our defence and autonomy in Europe,” he said. “We have an opportunity to build a strong local space economy [here] and to be leaders in certain areas, like propulsion systems. However, it’s an opportunity that will go to waste unless governments invest more [in space startups] and take a risk like they do in the US.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

The satellite internet provider, owned by Musk’s firm  SpaceX , has become embroiled in a hot debate among Italian politicians, as Rome weighs its strategic alliances amid mounting tensions between Europe and the US.   Italy’s right-wing League party is pushing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government to choose Starlink to provide satellite communications for government officials, citing the superiority of its technology over French rival Eutelsat. Starlink has around 6,700 active satellites in orbit, while Eutelsat has just over 600.   “In the Italian interest it would be odd to choose a French entity instead of a more technologically developed and avant-garde system like the American one,” the League said in a statement late on Thursday,  Reuters  reported.    Musk welcomed the remarks. He  replied  “much appreciated,” to a post on X that referred to the statement.    3 free tickets to TNW Conference? Get them now! For a limited time, groups can get up to three extra free tickets!

However, opposition parties have warned against relying on Musk’s firm — a concern heightened by reports that the US may cut Ukraine off from Starlink if a minerals deal is not reached, potentially severing a critical tool in Kyiv’s fight against Russia.     There are signs that Meloni might be cooling on Musk’s firm too.  Bloomberg  reported yesterday that the Italian government was having “growing doubts” about closing the Starlink contract, valued at  €1.5bn, in light of escalating transatlantic tensions.    If Italy were to drop the proposed deal,  an alternative provider that’s attracting interest in Eutelsat .  The firm’s CEO  Eva Berneke  said Tuesday that the company was in talks with the EU about extending its internet service to Ukraine, sending its shares  soaring 119% .    In  an interview  on Thursday, Berneke said the company was also in discussions with Italy. However, Meloni’s office told Reuters that it had not yet entered any formal negotiations with Eutelsat or other operators.     The debate is part of a broader discussion in Italy and Europe about reducing reliance on non-European tech for critical infrastructure.   Starlink isn’t the only Musk venture that’s recently come under scrutiny. The fortunes of his car company, Tesla, have also been linked to his political manoeuvres.  New registrations of Tesla vehicles  plummeted  across Europe  last month , a trend which analysts have linked to Musk’s role in the Trump administration and his open support of far-right politicians . However, Tesla registrations were  up slightly  in the UK and the US in February, so there’s one win for Elon.

What’s inside could change our understanding of dark matter and the expansion of the universe.   The data comprises just one week’s worth of deep field images from three points in space.  They make up just 0.4% of the vast area Euclid will capture, which scientists say will be the largest 3D map of the sky ever created.   W ith one scan of each region so far,  Euclid  has already spotted 26 million galaxies, each potentially containing millions of stars and billions of planets. The furthest of these galaxies are 10.5 billion light years away from Earth, meaning the images you see are almost as old as the universe itself.

Credit: ESA   Hiding amongst all those millions of galaxies are rare phenomena called gravitational lenses or “Einstein rings,” named as such because they prove Albert Einstein’s prediction that gravity warps spacetime, causing light to bend as it travels through. Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy or black hole, bends the light from a galaxy behind it — forming visible distortions or arcs around the galaxy’s nucleus.     Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       In this new batch of data, Euclid has more than doubled the number of gravitational lenses that have been captured from  space . ESA estimates that Euclid  will capture 100,000 strong gravitational lenses by the end of its six-year mission, around 100 times more than currently known.      Today’s data has also revealed an even rarer phenomenon: double gravitational lensing, also called double source plane lensing. This happens when light from two distant galaxies passes through the same galaxy, causing a double lensing effect.   Finding double gravitational lenses   A collage of gravitational lenses from Euclid’s first major data drop, released today. Credit: ESA   Look at the image above and go to the fourth column, third from the bottom. The image is faint but you can make out two outer arcs and then two inner arcs close to the centre of the galaxy nucleus. That’s a double gravitational lens.    Double gravitational lensing could help scientists better understand dark energy and the expansion of the universe, because, in theory, an expanding universe will determine the angle of the arcs.    “Double-source plane lenses are extremely rare — only a few have ever been found,” said Euclid Consortium scientist Mike Walmsley at a press briefing. “But we think we’ve found four good candidates already from just a week’s worth of data covering a fraction of the night sky. We’re confident that Euclid will quickly capture enough of them to allow scientists to start measuring their effects.”   To find such rare phenomena hiding amidst Euclid’s images, the  European Space Agency  (ESA) enlisted the help of thousands of volunteers — and AI algorithms.     Euclid’s AI-powered galaxy finder   Launched in 2023, Euclid has  observed about 14% of its total survey area so far. By the time its mission is complete, the telescope is expected to capture images of more than 1.5 billion galaxies, sending back around 100GB of data every day.    These images provide scientists with unprecedented opportunities — and huge problems when it comes to finding, categorising, and analysing all the objects within them.    To speed up the process, the Euclid consortium has developed an AI-powered galaxy spotter — called “Zoobot.” The algorithm was trained on decades’ worth of citizen science work, from volunteers who scan through images and identify each object.    A collage of galaxies identified by AI and citizen scientists. Credit: ESA   From today’s  data  drop, Zoobot put together a detailed catalogue of 360,000 galaxies. Thousands  of volunteers from the  Space Warps  citizen science project then sorted through the most promising candidates. That’s how the gravitational lenses were identified.    “We’re at a pivotal moment in terms of how we tackle large-scale surveys in astronomy. AI is a fundamental and necessary part of our process in order to fully exploit  Euclid ’s vast dataset,” said Walmsley, who has worked on astronomical deep learning algorithms for the last decade.

It returned its  first images  in August of that year, and in May last year released its  first scientific data .    Euclid’s mission is to shed light on two of the universe’s most perplexing mysteries: dark energy and dark matter —, thought to make up 95% of the cosmos. Scientists theorise that dark energy is responsible for accelerating the universe’s expansion and that dark matter acts as cosmic glue that holds the galaxies together. Yet the nature of these components is still unknown.   To build its 3D map of the night sky, the telescope is deploying two high-tech cameras: VIS, which captures the cosmos in visible light, and NISP, which measures the distances to galaxies and the expansion speed of the universe.    Euclid is set to provide us with an unprecedented chronology of the history of the cosmos and help us unravel the mysteries of the universe – and our own existence.

The pair met while working on IoT systems at British chip firm Arm.    At Edge Impulse, Shelby and Jongboom built a platform the slashes the time it takes to create machine learning models for small devices such as sensors, microcontrollers, and cameras.   Shelby said the team had identified a big gap in the market.   “ Recognising that the compute capabilities of microcontrollers had grown to the point where they were able to run domain-specific AI models directly onboard, we realised there were an endless number of use cases that would benefit from moving AI from the cloud to the edge,”  he wrote in a  blog post .   Edge Impulse has raised  $54.3mn to date. In 2021, the company bagged $34mn in Series B funding at a valuation of $234mn. Two years later, it  reported  revenues of $14.7mn. Its platform is currently  used by over 170,000 developers to create, deploy, and monitor AI models on the edge.   Shelby credited the platform’s popularity to helping  developers  eliminate laborious and manual tasks when setting up AI in edge devices.    “Edge Impulse gives developers a tool that automates  data  collection, simplifies model training, provides advanced optimisation tools, and offers one-click deployment to many types of hardware, from MCUs to CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs,” he said.          “The Next in Tech” is one of three key themes at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Analysts believe the disruption was caused by botnets — but finding the culprits will be a tall order.      The outages began at around 14:00 CET and lasted for most of the afternoon, trailing off at around 18:00, according to  Down Detector . While the outages appeared to have flatlined overnight, there was an uptick in reports of downtime starting from 08:00AM today up until the time of writing.   “We’re not sure exactly what happened,” Musk said during a Fox Business  interview . “But there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the X system, with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”    In a separate post on X, Musk said: “ We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.” The multi-billionaire  has not provided any evidence to back up his claims.    Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       Toby Lewis, head of threat analysis at UK-based cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said the X outage appears to be a “fairly standard DDoS attack”, which involves many devices flooding a server or network with traffic to overwhelm and shut it down.   “These sorts of attacks are almost always delivered by botnets — globally distributed networks of computers that have been unknowingly recruited to take part in the attack, typically through some form of compromise or the use of malware,” said Lewis.   With botnets, hackers can control devices in a country without actually being there. So even if the IP addresses did originate Ukraine, as Musk claimed, that doesn’t necessarily mean the attack has any link to the country or its government.    Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at Slovakian firm ESET, highlighted the method’s ability to conceal the culprits’ identities.    “DDoS attacks are a clever way of targeting a website without having to hack into the mainframe and therefore the perpetrators can remain largely anonymous and difficult to point a finger at,” he said.   X adds to mounting problems for Musk   Musk bought Twitter in October 2022 in a deal worth $44bn. Within a year, he had changed the platform’s name to X, laid off around 80% of the company’s staff and made  sweeping changes  to its content moderation policies.    Since Musk took over, there have been a series of  glitches  on the platform. X’s last major outage was in August last year, when hundreds of thousands of listeners were  unable  to access his interview with the then former US president Donald Trump. Musk later blamed the incident on a “massive” DDoS attack.       Whether yesterday’s attack had political or ideological motivations will be virtually impossible to ascertain. However, it comes amid a swathe of backlash against Musk, whose role in the US government and  open support of  far-right politicians  is causing controversy and  anger .    Tesla stock fell to a five-year low on Monday amid protests and  arson attacks  against the EV brand, which many see as symbolic of Musk, the company’s CEO and founder. A report last week found that  Tesla sales  in Germany fell 70% in February, off the back of a 60% sales slump in January.    Analysts have linked Tesla’s fallout to Musk’s increasingly  incendiary  behaviour.  In Europe, Musk has openly endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD, even hosting an interview on X where he  heaped praise  on the party’s leader Alice Weidel. At the Trump inauguration on January 20, Musk made a controversial hand gesture, which many likened to a Nazi salute.    “There is no doubt that ‘the Musk factor’ has influenced Tesla’s sales in the same way as his reputation impacted Twitter when he bought it and rebranded it as X,” Andrew Fellows, an automotive industry expert at Star, a tech consultancy firm,  previously told TNW .   Musk’s antics have put Starlink, a subsidiary of his firm SpaceX, in hot water too.  Officials in Europe  are considering replacing  the satellite internet service with a homegrown alternative amid mounting concerns about putting the continent’s security in the hands of a single, private network whose owner has direct ties to the US government.

It allows the armed forces to coordinate drone strikes, identify targets, and stream  battlefield data to troops on the ground in real-time.   However, European leaders are increasingly concerned about relying on Starlink — fears stoked by a  Reuters  report that US officials had threatened to cut off the system in Ukraine if the country didn’t meet their demands on sharing its mineral wealth. Elon Musk, CEO of Starlink’s parent company SpaceX, refuted the claims. Nevertheless, the situation has raised doubts over the security implications of Ukraine — and broader Europe — relying on a single, privately owned network whose boss has direct ties to the Trump administration.    In response, discussions with European alternatives to Starlink are in full swing. Leading the pack is French/British satellite provider  Eutelsat. The firm’s CEO,  Eva Berneke,  confirmed to  Bloomberg  last week that it was in talks with the EU about extending its internet service to Ukraine. Berneke said Eutelsat was also in “very positive talks” with Italy, whose  government is fiercely debating  whether to pick Starlink to provide encrypted communications for government officials.     Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       Three other companies — the UK’s Inmarsat,  Luxembourg’s SES, and Spain’s Hisdesat — told the  Financial Times  they were also discussing with governments and EU institutions about how to provide back-up connectivity to Ukraine. Miguel Ángel García Primo, CEO of Hisdesat, which provides secure satellite communications for governments, said his company had been contacted by several European officials.   But replacing Starlink won’t be easy. Starlink is by far the largest satellite comms provider, with over 7,000 probes in low-Earth orbit and 40,000 terminals on the ground in Ukraine alone.    However, Berneke was bullish on Eutelsat’s capabilities. She said that the firm could match Starlink’s terminal count in Ukraine “probably in a couple of months.” Eutelsat already has 2,000 terminals in the war-torn country.   Whether a Starlink back-up service would comprise a mesh of different operators or just one is unclear at this stage. Either way, these four companies likely present Europe’s best option right now to cut ties with Musk’s firm and put the region’s satellite communications in safer hands.    Longer term, Europe has its bets placed on  IRIS² , a planned multi-orbit satellite internet constellation expected to switch on in 2030. There are also reports of an  Airbus-Leonardo-Thales Alenia Space  joint venture  called “Project Bromo” that could challenge Starlink’s global dominance.

She also said Eutelsat was in “very positive talks” with Italy to provide an encrypted communications service for government officials. In the same week, investors rallied behind Eutelsat, sending its  shares soaring  over 500%.   But what exactly is Eutelsat? And could it realistically replace Starlink in Ukraine and beyond?    An independence mission   In 1977, 17 European countries came together to form  the  European  Telecommunications Satellite Organisation — “Eutelsat” for short.  The idea was to develop a satellite-based telecommunications infrastructure independent from the US or the Soviet Union.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       In 1983, Eutelsat became the first European provider of  satellite TV. In 2001, the company was privatised, and in 2023 it merged with the UK’s OneWeb to become the world’s third largest satellite operator.    With the merger,  Eutelsat inherited  OneWeb’s constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites for internet communications — a similar setup to its bigger rival Starlink.    How do OneWeb’s satellites work?   Eutelsat currently has 653 OneWeb satellites orbiting the Earth, each circling about 1,200km above the surface. This relative proximity results in lower latency and faster internet speeds compared to traditional geostationary satellites, which are around 30 times further out in  space .     Ground stations on Earth are connected to the internet and beam  data  to satellites orbiting above. The satellites then transmit the data to user terminals, small devices with antennas that enable internet access in places where traditional connections aren’t available. These user terminals are especially useful in remote areas, airplanes, ships, vehicles, or — as we’ve seen in Ukraine — conflict zones.     Can Eutelsat replace Starlink in Ukraine?       Eutelsat told TNW that it offers the same coverage and latency capabilities as Starlink. The firm’s low-Earth orbit (LEO) services are already deployed in Ukraine, where they support government and institutional communications. Additionally, Eutelsat said its geostationary orbit (GEO) systems could provide extra capacity over Ukraine, as well as “stronger resilience” for critical infrastructure connectivity.   Currently, Eutelsat has around 2,000 user terminals on the ground in Ukraine. That’s dwarfed by Starlink’s 40,000, yet Berneke said her company could reach that number “in a couple of months.”   Ramping up capacity that quickly, though, would present some serious logistical challenges, especially as OneWeb  terminals are supplied by third-party companies, unlike Starlink, which builds its in-house.    Poland  and the US, among others, have helped to fund Ukraine’s use of Starlink. Similar support would likely be needed for  a rapid rollout of OneWeb terminals, particularly given Eutelsat’s not-so-healthy  financial concerns .     Then there’s the tech itself. OneWeb’s satellites are older and less advanced than Starlink’s. They lack inter-satellite laser link technology, which improves coverage. They also have far fewer satellites in orbit than Starlink, which has around 7,000.    However, if the EU is serious about replacing Starlink in Ukraine, it’ll probably have to settle for second-best. The bloc will also have to make some serious financial commitments. Word from Poland this weekend provided positive news on that front.    In a  post  on X on Sunday, Poland’s foreign minister said the country would be forced  to “look for other suppliers”  if SpaceX “proves to be an unreliable provider.”  Warsaw currently funds half of the 42,000 Starlink terminals operating in the country at a cost of about $50mn a year.   In the longer term, Europe has its bets placed on   IRIS² , a multi-orbit satellite internet constellation expected to switch on in 2030. There are also reports that a new Airbus-Leonardo-Thales Alenia Space   joint venture   called “Project Bromo” plans to challenge Starlink’s global dominance.

An executive at Murena, a French smartphone startup, said today that breaking up the businesses is the only way to end Google’s “cycle of domination”.   The appeal follows a Friday court filing from the US Department of Justice (DOJ). The filing reaffirmed  a proposal  for Google to divest its Chrome browser and sell it to a competitor, in a bid to break up the tech giant’s alleged search engine monopoly.    “Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public — their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ said  in the filing .    The accusation echoes common complaints about Chrome’s dominance.

In February, Chrome made up two thirds of the  global browser market . Next up was Safari with 17.99%, Edge (5.33%), Firefox (2.62%), and Samsung Internet (2.3%).  Opera, Europe’s largest homegrown browser, made up just 2.09%.    The DOJ’s plan aims to level the playing field. But Rik Viergever, COO at Murena, a French company building privacy-first smartphones, believes the new proposals alone aren’t enough.    “As a data privacy advocate, I welcome the DOJ’s decision forcing Google to sell Chrome, however this should only be the start,” he said. “I want to see Google sell the Android operating system.”   The government has left this possibility open, but is first calling for  Google  to change the business practices of Android. If these measures fail to curb Google’s market dominance, the DOJ may push for divestment from the operating system.   Viergever wants the courts to do more to ease Google’s “stranglehold” on consumers and competitors.   “Google is only able to offer Android free of charge to users because it profits off them in so many other ways and markets,” he said. “This makes it almost impossible for other providers in the operating system market to compete and so the cycle of domination continues.”   Viergever’s stance aligns with Murena’s mission. The company’s main products are  “deGoogled” smartphones  billed as privacy-centric disruptors to the Apple-Google mobile duopoly.    The devices use  /e/OS ,  a privacy-oriented, open-source alternative to Android .  Murena built the software to escape the shackles of Google’s operating system.   Viergever argues that selling Chrome would lead to better products.   “It’s time to open the market up to innovation and competition so users can benefit from a competitive industry in which businesses compete with products that benefit consumers, rather than a big company like Google holding all the power,” he said.

That is, perhaps, until now.    British startup Longbow — founded by former Tesla, Lucid, and Polestar execs — emerged from stealth today with plans for two new ultralight  EVs . The company bills the cars as “spiritual successors” to the iconic Lotus Elise and Jaguar E-Type.   The first of the pair is Speedster, a nimble, open-top sports car weighing just 895kg that could accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 3.5 seconds. Speedster will have an estimated range of 275 miles and a starting price of ₤84,995. The first customer deliveries are slated for 2026.   Longbow said it initially wants to build 150 Speedsters. Following that, it plans to put its full attention on the EV’s slightly bulkier and cheaper brother — the Roadster. Costing ₤64,995 and weighing 995kg, the Roadster will be heavier but only marginally slower, accelerating from 0 to 100km/h in 3.6 seconds.     TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       Both the Speedster and the Roadster are featherweights in comparison to today’s EVs, which on average  weigh  around 2,000kg. In the sports car class, Tesla’s Roadster, which tipped the scales at 1,305kg, was one of the lightest ever to enter serial production, but that was phased out in 2012.     “Our first two cars embody everything a modern driver’s car should be: agile, balanced, electric, and exhilarating,” said Longbow’s co-founder and CEO David Davey, whose previous accomplishments include launching Lucid Motors in Europe and  claims to have driven the Tesla Roadster that Elon Musk launched into space . “We are reviving an icon, the lightweight British sports car,” he said.    Together, the Roadster and Speedster represent a whole new class of cars — and a middle finger to the auto establishment.    The Speedster is a throwback to iconic British sports cars. Credit: Longbow   Over the years, EVs have been getting bigger and bigger — in market share, sure — but also in  physical size .  That’s partly because batteries are getting heavier and taking up more space . But it’s also because automakers are catering to demand for electric equivalents of SUVs, pickup trucks, and even  hummers .    “Astonishingly, the very segment that sparked the electric revolution — the global 2 seater sports car market worth approximately $16bn, encompassing around 250,000 vehicles per year — remains almost untouched by electrification,” Davey wrote on  LinkedIn .    With most established automakers all competing in the same segment, Longbow looks to seize a gap in the market.    Longbow’s EV credentials   That all sounds great, but what sets this apart from all the other fancy 3D renders out there?   First, Longbow’s CV is drenched in EV acumen. The founders — Davey, Jenny Keisu, and Mark Tapscott — have combined experience launching electric vehicles at Tesla, Uber, Polestar, and Lucid. Keisu was the CEO of X Shore, adding electric boating expertise into the mix. “We bring experience from the heart of EV innovation, understanding intimately how to design and deliver game-changing vehicles at commercial scale,” said Davey.    The Longbow founders (left to right): Daniel Davey, Jenny Keisu, and Mark Tapscott. Credit: Longbow   Then there’s Longbow’s rather modest designs and specs. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the company is adopting a basic aluminium chassis, featuring reusable and configurable parts for greater durability. It also plans to source most of the car’s parts from third parties. That includes a rather basic 240kW motor, readily available off-the-shelf.    Yes, this all makes both the Speedster and Roadster slower than an  electric hypercar  and less fancy than a  Porsche Taycan  or  Maserati Granturismo Folgore . But then again, it’s also a fraction of the price. Longbow’s pair of EVs could be the sweet spot for someone looking for a Sunday drive to replace their old Porsche Boxster or Lotus Elise.    The Roadster is the bigger brother of the Speedster. Credit: Longbow   The Speedster and Roadster are already available for pre-order. And Longbow — which has been operating in stealth for the last few years — hopes to unveil its first prototype later this year.    “We’re not naïve about the challenges ahead,” said Davey. “Scaling production, navigating global supply chain complexities, and confronting competition from legacy automakers requires strategic foresight.” For these reasons, the company will start with a limited edition Speedster of 150 units before moving to series production of the Roadster.     “The Next in Tech” is one of three key themes at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

However, these systems are general — they are jacks of all trades but masters of none.    Increasingly, though, scientists are training AI to solve very specific problems and fast-track everything from  creating new drugs  to  designing fusion reactors . One area where they’re gaining traction is enhanced material discovery. Their advances are creating a growing range of promising startups. PhaseTree is one of them.   Spun-off from the Technical University of Denmark in 2021, PhaseTree has developed a platform that integrates computer simulations, lab automation, and  AI  to develop new materials for clean technologies like batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. While it’s not unveiling its secret sauce, the startup said the tech enables it to find new materials 10 times faster than traditional methods.    “Our approach accelerates discovery by combining physics-based modelling with AI, allowing us to rapidly identify and refine promising candidates that would traditionally take decades to develop,” Jin Hyun Chang, PhaseTree’s co-founder and CTO, told TNW.     TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       PhaseTree is in an increasingly crowded sector. AI-powered material discovery startups raised over $260mn last year, according to Dealroom data. Ten out of the 17 funding rounds in 2024 went to  startups  in Europe, including  ExoMatter, Dunia, and Orbital.    PhaseTree promotes a different approach to its rivals.  Unlike many other AI-powered material discovery tools, Chang said the startup prioritises using existing scientific methods first, and then applies machine learning in an approach it calls “physics-first, AI-on-top.”     “Many AI-driven tools rely heavily on data correlations, but we emphasise the physical principles governing materials such as composition, atomic structure, defects, and microstructures, to ensure a reliable prediction of the materials properties,” he explained.   Today, PhaseTree announced that it has secured  €3mn in  funding  from Denmark-based early-stage VC Heartcore Capital. It will use the fresh funds to boost R&D and expand its team,  as it looks to deploy its science to solve real-world problems.   Amit Luthra, co-founder and CEO of PhaseTree, emphasised the company’s focus on practical applications.   “From the outset, we design materials with manufacturability in mind, ensuring they can be synthesised at scale rather than remaining a theoretical concept or lab-scale prototypes,” Luthra told TNW. “By prioritising low-cost, abundant materials with straightforward synthesis routes, we maximise the likelihood of adoption by key industrial players.”   PhaseTree said it is currently working with some of the world’s largest battery, automobile, and steel producers, and is already optimising high-performance battery electrodes and advanced alloys.    “The Next in Tech” is one of three key themes at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Earth to Mars? Four months. Earth to Saturn? Two years.     Rather than launch from Earth each time, several Sunbirds would be “docked” in  low-Earth orbit , ready to attach to spacecraft and propel them deeper into the cosmos.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       Sunbird would be fitted with a Duel Direct Fusion Drive — a compact nuclear fusion engine which could provide both thrust and electrical power for spacecraft.    Pulsar started building the engine  in 2023 at a site in  Milton Keynes , England. Static tests are slated to begin in 2025 followed by an “In Orbit Demonstration” (IOD) of the core technology components in 2027, the company said. When fired, the engine could temporarily become the hottest place in the solar system, creating exhaust speeds of more than 500,000mph (804,672km/h).        From the UK to Mars   Founded in 2011, Pulsar has spent over a decade on fusion research. More recently, the company started developing two other products in parallel:  a Hall-effect electric thruster for spacecraft and a second-stage hybrid rocket engine.   “ Pulsar has built a reputation in this industry for delivering real technology — not just talking about it,” said founder and CEO Richard Dinan. “We’ve recently commissioned not one, but two of the largest space propulsion testing chambers in the UK, if not all of Europe — and we have ambitious plans to grow from here.”   While Pulsar’s goal to build and test a fusion reactor in  space  in just three years is certainly ambitious, advances in AI could help.

Originally scheduled for December, the Ariane 6 mission was delayed first to February 26 and subsequently to March 3 due to issues in transporting the satellite to the launchpad. However, just minutes before Monday’s launch, engineers identified an “anomaly” in one of the refuelling pipes, postponing the launch further.   Finally, Ariane 6 had its first successful commercial launch today. The milestone came seven months after the rocket’s  maiden flight , which restored sovereign access to  space  for Europe.      Ariane 6 carried CSO-3, a French military spy satellite capable of taking high resolution images of Earth. The probe is the final piece of a three-satellite system designed to improve France’s ability to monitor global activities from space. The first two probes were launched aboard  Russian Soyuz rockets  in 2018 and 2020.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       Since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, Europe has been unable to access Soyuz rockets. Meanwhile, the  retirement of the Ariane 5  in 2023 and delays to the new Vega-C small-launch vehicle left the continent without independent access to space.  Europe was forced to rely on Elon Musk’s SpaceX for over a year.   The Ariane 6 mission   In 2023, Europe completed only three successful  orbital launches  — its lowest total since 2004. The US, meanwhile, had 109 — the most a single country has ever made.   However, with Ariane 6 now up-and-running and Vega-C having launched in December, things are looking up for Europe’s space capabilities. And it’s not just publicly-funded missions that are on track.   German startup Isar Aerospace is  ready  to blast Europe’s first privately-funded rocket in orbit from  Andøya Spaceport  in  Norway, pending regulatory signoff. Isar is one of several startups like  PLD Space  and  Rocket Factory Augsburg  looking to provide a local alternative to SpaceX. Both of those companies are also set to launch for the first time this year.    The progress of European rocket startups — and veterans like Arianespace and Avio (the company behind Vega-C) — couldn’t come at a better time. European states have long sought to strengthen their security autonomy, a priority that has gained renewed urgency following the Trump administration’s thawing relations with Russia.   However, Europe might not be able to replace SpaceX altogether. Ariane 6, unlike SpaceX rockets, is not reusable. And while Europe is fostering private companies with reusable, light-lift rockets, it likely won’t have a reusable heavy-lift option until the 2030s, when a successor to Ariane 6 may emerge.    Nevertheless, while not a panacea for Europe’s autonomy in space, the boost in local capabilities is still good news for the region’s broader space tech sector. “The increased access [to space] will no doubt accelerate the pace of innovation and deployment of new space technologies in Europe,” Mark Boggett, the CEO of investment firm Seraphim Space, previously  told TNW .    The progress could also yield immense financial rewards.  McKinsey and the World Economic Forum expect the global space economy to rise from $630 billion in value in 2023 to $1.8 trillion by 2035.

The aircraft will serve as a testbed for hypersonic flight and defence research. It  could be used as a small satellite carrier if fitted with a non-reusable upper stage, Polaris said.    Polaris was founded in 2019 by Alexander Kopp as a spin-off from the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It builds upon over three decades of German and European spaceplane research.    3 free tickets to TNW Conference? Get them now! For a limited time, groups can get up to three extra free tickets!

The first, Mira I, crashed shortly after its inaugural flight. But the next two iterations — Mira-II and Mira-III — had better luck. These 5-meter-long vehicles, each weighing 240kg, have completed over 100 successful test flights since they first launched in September last year.   The Mira prototype series relies on jet engines for takeoff, cruise, and landing, while incorporating an aerospike rocket engine for high-speed propulsion tests. First conceived in the 1960s, aerospike engines adjust to air pressure changes at all altitudes, making them more efficient than traditional designs.   However, aerospikes never entered the mainstream because they are hard to cool and difficult to build. Polaris’ work on advanced cooling technologies and materials may just overcome past engineering challenges.    Polaris made history in October last year when it conducted the first-ever flight powered by an aerospike engine. The AS-1 engine was ignited in flight for three seconds aboard the Mira-II over the Baltic Sea, delivering a thrust of 900 Newtons and accelerating the 229kg vehicle to 864km/h.     The Mira’s future big sister Aurora, however, will be designed to reach hypersonic speeds above Mach 5 (over 6,125km/h) and beyond.    Spaceplanes like Aurora could prove a more cost-effective way to access  space  than rockets because they can take off from a conventional runway and be reused time and time again — just like a plane, but with more juice.     Polaris’ announcement comes days after Germany’s incoming Chancellor  Friedrich  Merz cast doubts over whether NATO would remain in its “current form,” urging Europe to increase  defence spending .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), Britain’s data privacy watchdog, stresses that despite the insolvency, customers remain protected by the same data privacy laws.   3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

Earlier this month, the ICO issued a notice of intent to fine the company £4.59mn ($5.93mn).      “Genetic information is among the most sensitive personal data that a person can entrust to a company[,] and organisations handling such data are required to uphold a very high standard of security and governance in accordance with [the law],” Bonner said in response to the bankruptcy filing.    In the US, meanwhile, the legal protections vary.   While users in the UK and EU have GDPR protections, data  privacy  laws in the US are less comprehensive and vary considerably from state to state.    23andMe claims that the company does not share the personal or medical information of any of its customers without consent. Yet with 23andMe’s track record, neither the company’s assurances nor legal protections may quell customers’ fears. During bankruptcy proceedings, the company may also have fewer resources at its disposal to fight off hackers. And under new ownership, things look even more uncertain.   According to 23andMe’s own  privacy statement , if the company undergoes bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganisation, or sale of assets,  “your Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction.”    How to delete your 23andMe data   Given the sensitivity of the data people have shared with 23andMe, the previous breach, and the company’s financial problems, customers may decide to just delete their data entirely.  California Attorney General Rob Bonta has  urged  them to do just that.    “I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” Bonta said.   Users in Europe, meanwhile, have the “right to erasure,” which allows individuals to request that 23andMe deletes their personal data and destroys any medical samples in the company’s possession.     Here’s how to do it:      L og in to your account and go to “Settings,” then scroll to “23andMe Data” and click “View.”    From there, select “Delete Data,” confirm your request, and your data will be permanently removed. You can also download a copy of your genetic data before deleting it.   To delete your test sample, go to “Settings,” then “Preferences,” where you can manage your options.        Europe’s tech regulations will come under the microscope at  TNW Conference ,  Tickets for the event are  now on sale .

Casting envious eyes on the deep-pocketed VCs, an enormous consumer market, and a pipeline of elite talent, they often view the US as a promised land for business growth.   The sentiment fuels calls for Europe to replicate Silicon Valley’s model. But Vidya Peters, CEO of Dutch unicorn DataSnipper, argues this approach is flawed.   Rather than merely mimicking US tech, she urges startups and scaleups to embrace Europe’s strengths. A key one is sustainable, long-term growth.   “Five years ago, it wasn’t very fashionable to be profitable,” Peters tells TNW. “But I think this is where the European sensibility is a strength, because European companies have always taken this approach, and now it’s hugely valued in the current economic climate.”   3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

European businesses are already benefiting from this distinct approach.  “W hen you watch some of these companies come out, they are much more durable in their growth and competitive advantage,” Peters says.   DataSnipper is a prime example. The company was profitable early on, scaled rapidly, and recently hit a $1bn valuation. Ahead of her headline talk at  TNW Conference  in June, Peters shared a few secrets behind the company’s success.   One is based on another European trademark:  data  protection .  Privacy and security are integral features of DataSnipper’s core product, an AI-powered platform that automates repetitive finance and audit procedures.     “It’s been super important to our customers that we’re not training on their documents and data — and that’s been a central piece of how we built our AI products,” Peters says. “We review and look at their data to provide insights, but that data is theirs.”   The company must also abide by the EU’s stringent data laws. Critics argue that these rules  stifle innovation , but Peters points to the advantages.   “Europe really has the opportunity to lead in this space by balancing innovation with customer data protection,” she says.   By embedding safety and transparency into AI, she continues,  startups  and scaleups can carve out a competitive edge over US rivals.   “Doing it from a base of trust can help European companies win customers in a different way than their American counterparts can.”   DataSnipper also has roots in another European hallmark : a bar in Amsterdam.    From Amsterdam to the world   In 2017, Maarten Alblas and Jonas Ruyter were having a beer. Joining them was a friend who worked in auditing for KPMG. He faced a common affliction in his profession: an enormous spreadsheet that required painstaking scrutiny. He had to search through the document for invoices, bank statements, and receipts — all the while cross-checking the data.    Alblas and Ruyter believed software could ease his suffering. They settled on a solution: an intelligent automation platform that would dramatically increase the quality and efficiency of common audit procedures. The idea led to the founding of DataSnipper.   Their software proved a hit with auditors. Soon, their user base had spread from the Netherlands to the UK and Germany. After finding success in  Europe , they targeted new markets beyond the continent.   To further fuel the growth, the company appointed Vidya Peters as CEO in 2023. She joined with expertise honed in Silicon Valley, most recently as Chief Marketing Officer of MuleSoft. During her time at the software giant, the company went public on the NYSE before being acquired by Salesforce for $6.5bn.    She later gained extensive experience of Europe’s tech landscape. In 2019, she served as Chief Operating Officer of Marqeta, a payment processing firm. Again, she helped her company go public. In 2022, Marqeta made its market debut on the Nasdaq. The company ended the day with a market cap of over $16bn.   At DataSnipper, she set her sights on accelerating growth and global expansion.   The strategy has reaped rewards. In 2024, Deloitte named DataSnipper the  fastest-growing tech company  in the Netherlands for the second year in a row. Last month, the business reached the coveted unicorn status after raising $100mn at a $1bn valuation. Over 500,000 audit and finance professionals across more than 125 countries now use the software.   As DataSnipper scaled, the company benefited from another European advantage: access to international talent.    DataSnipper’s talent pipeline   “People undervalue the ability to hire from across the world here,” says Peters.   DataSnipper has directly benefited from this access. From the Netherlands, the company can hire global talent on a visa with greater ease than in the US. Peters describes this as “a secret weapon” for European startups and scaleups.   “It is much easier to do so with the visa opportunities that you have in Europe, the ability to issue work visas is significantly easier in Europe than it is in the US.”   A diverse range of people now work for DataSnipper. In  the company’s Amsterdam headquarters, 70% of employees are from outside the Netherlands.   “That’s incredibly valuable because we have every language that you could possibly want to sell in Europe, and you can attract them right here to Amsterdam,” says Peters.   DataSnipper’s global outlook has been instrumental in its expansion. After establishing itself in Europe, DataSnipper opened offices in New York, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Mexico City.   Despite its global expansion, DataSnipper remains firmly rooted in the Netherlands. One of the country’s many attractions is a simple matter of time.   “People forget that America is not the heart of the world,” says Peters. “You can wake up in Europe and sell to Asia Pacific. And after your lunch, you can sell to the US.”   Europe’s pros and cons   Despite the advantages of life in Europe, startups here still face substantial challenges. One is the diverging regulations, tax laws, and banking systems, which present roadblocks to growth across the continent.   “We’re not taking full advantage of being part of one European Union and allowing companies to expand within the continent,” Peters says. “It would be tremendously beneficial if we could open locations within Europe, just like you would in the US, in a different state.”   Funding is another hurdle. European VCs tend to be  more risk-averse , making capital harder to secure. “We had conversations with probably every major venture capital firm in the US — they were pounding on our door,” says Peters. “Yet the European VCs were not reaching out.”   For DataSnipper, that wasn’t a big problem. The US firms alone had produced an oversubscribed round. Nonetheless, Peters was surprised: where were the European investors? With curious timing, they started reaching out after the funding was announced.   “Was it the risk appetite?” Peters wonders. “What was it that made them a little bit more cautious?”   These are common questions in European tech. But startups and scaleups don’t need to wait for the answers.   Peters advises them to think beyond borders. “Don’t be limited to the country you are in or to Europe,” she says. “Reach out to VCs all over the world.”   When that happens, Peters hopes that Europe’s investment landscape will shift to a braver funding model. But even if it doesn’t, companies across the continent can forge their own paths to success.

Alex Kendall, co-founder and CEO of Wayve, called it the “perfect place” for the company to accelerate the development and testing of AI-powered driving technology.     “2025 is a year of global expansion for Wayve, and we are incredibly excited to establish operations in Germany,” said Kendall.   Wayve is already testing its technology in the UK and the US. The startup’s new  testing hub in Baden-Württemberg will focus on refining its Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) features, including lane change assistance, and advancing automated driving technology. The site also offers access to Germany’s deep pool of software engineering talent, key to the company’s development efforts.

View the Speakers                       Founded in Cambridge in 2017, Wayve fits a regular car with a range of cameras and sensors that interpret the surrounding environment. This data gets fed to Wayve’s so-called “embodied AI” system.   Unlike many other self-driving  AI  models, which have to be trained on each possible driving scenario and are confined to geofenced limits, Wayve’s AI is more free to act and learn on its own. The more the AI “drives,” the better it becomes at responding to hazards.   Wayve’s approach to autonomous driving is similar to Tesla’s. But unlike  Elon Musk’s firm , Wayve will sell its technology directly to carmakers. This means you won’t have to buy a  Tesla  to access top spec self-driving tech.   “I look forward to partnering with Germany’s world-leading manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers to bring safe, scalable, and production-ready AI software to vehicles worldwide,” said Kendall.    The news follows Wayve’s mega $1bn raise in May — the  largest-ever  single investment in a European AI startup.   SoftBank led the Series C round alongside tech giants Nvidia and Microsoft.    “Wayve is a singularly important company for Europe,” Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton and an early investor in Wayve, told TNW at the time.    “Embodied AI will be the next big frontier of artificial intelligence — bringing machine intelligence to the physical world around us and not just the computer screen that large language models are confined to.”     The approach has also attracted attention in the US.  In August, Wayve secured a  “strategic investment” from Uber , which is integrating autonomous driving tech into its fleet of taxis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

Now it can,” said Opera’s executive vice president Krystian Kolondra. “This is different from anything we’ve seen or shipped so far.”    Browser Operator isn’t just for shopping, though. It can search the web for whatever you need, potentially saving you time on menial tasks. Importantly, the tool comes with some built-in safeguards. You see what it’s doing at every step in the process and can easily pause or cancel any task.     Opera claims the AI agent is the first agentic browsing feature launched by any major browser. However, major AI firms are working on their versions of similar systems.   Last year, Anthropic launched a “computer use” feature that allows its Claude chatbot to take over your computer and browse on your behalf. OpenAI unveiled a similar feature — “Operator” — in January.     Both of those tools, however, are virtual machines that operate in the cloud. Simply put, this means they’re slow. In contrast, Opera’s tool operates locally, directly on your browser, making it potentially  much faster  — and more secure.    Unlike Claude or Operator, Opera’s agent doesn’t take screenshots or capture videos of your screen. By processing tasks locally, it ensures user data remains on the device, which the company said enhances privacy.   Opera plans to launch the full version of the Browser Operator in “the near future.” The tool is the latest in a long line of AI developments at the Norwegian company. In 2023, Opera launched a fully  AI-enabled browser , and last year it became the  first major browser to integrate large language models  (LLMs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

In the past few months alone, Google launched a chip called  Willow , Microsoft unveiled  Majorana , and this week, Amazon revealed  Ocelot .    While tech giants are making great strides, these companies are still working in dozens of qubits — far from the numbers needed for a practical quantum computer. QuantWare, a startup from the Netherlands, could help them unlock millions more.   QuantWare claims to have created a 3D chip architecture that offers the fastest route to a 1-million qubit quantum computer — and plans to sell it to Silicon Valley.       “We need to get to around a million qubits for a quantum computer capable of economically-relevant, world-changing calculations,” QuantWare’s co-founder and CEO,  Matthijs Rijlaarsdam, told TNW.  These would be large, megawatt-scale systems, comparable to today’s  AI  clusters, he said .

View the Speakers                       Qubits, like bits in a regular PC, are the basic units of information in a quantum  computer . The more you have, the faster the machine.    “Even Google took five years to double the number of qubits on its chips — from 50 to 100,”  said  Rijlaarsdam. “If this is the pace of scaling up, we’re not going to get there fast enough.”    Solving the quantum qubit conundrum   One of the biggest bottlenecks to scaling quantum computers is making room for more qubits.      Current designs route the electronic signals used to control the qubits to the edge of the chip. But as qubit numbers grow, space runs out.    Then you’ve got components like amplifiers, filters, and mixers that ensure signals are delivered with the right frequency, amplitude, and noise levels to perform accurate quantum calculations. In today’s quantum computers, each component is housed on a separate chip in a separate metal box — resulting in quantum computers growing too large too quickly.    QuantWare’s core offering —  vertical integration and optimisation, or VIO — promises to solve quantum’s scaling problem.    The 3D chip architecture replaces edge-based wiring, allowing signals to travel “from above,” producing higher qubit densities. VIO also integrates bulky components like amplifiers and filters onto a single quantum processor or ‘chip’.  In effect, it creates the quantum computing version of an integrated circuit in modern PCs.    “We provide the fastest path towards scaling towards a million qubit system,” said Rijlaarsdam. And because VIO enables all those qubits to be integrated into one chip, it will be “exponentially faster” than a system made up of several chips connected together, he said.    QuantWare cofounders Alessandro Bruno (left) and Matthijs Rijlaarsdam. Credit: QuantWare   Rijlaarsdam and Alessandro Bruno founded QuantWare in 2020 as a spinoff from TU Delft. The startup makes its own quantum chips and amplifiers, which are already found in quantum computers in 20 countries. It will use VIO to rapidly scale its processors. But it will also offer the technology to companies building their own quantum machines.    Big Tech, big customers   As tech giants compete in the race to a viable quantum computer, QuantWare is positioning itself to cash in. The  startup  aims to become the quantum equivalent of what TSMC is to Apple or Microsoft in classical computing — an enabler, not a competitor.    “Each Big Tech breakthrough reinforces QuantWare’s value proposition,” said  Rijlaarsdam.   Quantum computing has transformed in recent years from a speculative moonshot into a technology poised to turbo-charge everything from drug discovery to cryptography. Last year, quantum technologies attracted over  $49bn in public and private  investment .     “Quantum computing is less now a science problem than an engineering problem, and it will quickly become an economic problem: how can we scale as quickly as possible?” said  Rijlaarsdam.      Today, QuantWare rais ed €20mn in Series A funding to further develop VIO and build out its chip fabrication facilities. The round was co-led by Invest-NL Deep Tech Fund and Innovation Quarter.  Job van der Voort , founder and CEO of Remote, also came on board as an angel investor.   If QuantWare’s bet on 3D chip architecture pays off, it could offer a route to the million-qubit milestone needed to get quantum computers that truly change the world. The race is on.         “The Next in Tech” is one of three key themes at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam. Tickets for the event are   now on sale .

Men  dominate  the leadership of most companies in the sector. Women founders  struggle  to raise VC money, and there’s a stark  pay gap  between male and female workers. This gender imbalance is especially glaring in the STEM-dominated world of deep tech.    Women lead just 22% of European deep tech companies, according to a new report from the EU-funded GENDEX project, released today. Securing funding remains a challenge, with women-led firms taking six months longer to sign their first term sheet. Over the past decade, women-led companies raised 1.8 times less capital than those led by men. Even those that get funded often face less favourable terms.    European deep tech gender inequity limits diversity of thought and stifles innovation. It’s also pouring hundreds of billions of euros in potential revenue down the drain.   Data from the GENDEX report shows that women-led deep tech companies have generated over 11% of the total value raised at non-IPO exits in the past decade — a disproportionately low figure. However, these firms account for just 0.6% of such deals, highlighting the outsized value created when women take the lead.

View the Speakers                       Achieving greater representation of women-led companies at the exit stage — both IPO and non-IPO — over the past decade would have unlocked an estimated €198.8bn in additional value, GENDEX found.   “This data proves we need structural change,” said Tanya Suarez, the chair at GENDEX, as well as the CEO of consultancy firm BlueSpecs and  founder  of tech accelerator IoT Tribe. “Not only is it needed to fairly represent women, but evidence shows a gender-balanced ecosystem delivers the best results.”    Restricting European deep tech talent   While women make up 42% of STEM graduates in Europe, their representation drops sharply in the workforce. The GENDEX report finds that women account for just 24% of patent applicants, highlighting a talent drain that limits deep tech’s potential.   “Tapping into Europe’s diverse talent pool in the tech and investment sectors in the broadest and most effective way possible is vital if we are to capitalise fully on our many strengths in innovation,” said Stéphane Ouaki, head of department at the European Innovation Council, which funded the report.   The deep tech gender imbalance reflects broader societal gender issues. There is no quick fix — addressing it requires systemic change across education, investment, and workplace culture.    However, GENDEX makes four key recommendations to remedy the problem. First, investors should demand that companies report on gender diversity before deploying capital. Second, more funding should be allocated to women-led teams, which have  been shown  to deliver better outcomes. Third, better legal and funding support is needed for women to secure IP rights.

BlackRock’s product is called an “iShares Bitcoin ETP” (exchange-traded products). ETPs let investors buy and sell Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They are traded on stock exchanges and track the price of Bitcoin.

This enables investments in Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing a digital wallet or dealing with the complexities of buying Bitcoin directly.   “ ETPs offer institutional investors a way of accessing crypto without exposing themselves to the risks inherent in investing natively,” Anthony Yeung , CCO of Coincover, told TNW.   This type of investment vehicle is gaining momentum globally. Investors have already poured a combined  $50bn into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETPs in the US.    “If BlackRock’s success in the US is anything to go by, this will generate significant inflows of institutional cash [in Europe] — positively impacting Bitcoin price and helping drive acceptance of crypto as an essential asset to hold in a balanced portfolio,”  Yeung said.    Europe’s ETP landscape   While Europe was slower to adopt ETPs than the US, it is now catching up. That’s partly thanks to  the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which entered force late last year.    The legislation provides a clear and structured framework for launching new products.   In the  US, oversight is more fragmented.   Last year, Europe had $12bn of ETP assets under management. While that still paled in comparison to the US ($57bn), it represents a tenfold increase from 2020 levels.    In terms of investment options, though, Europe hosts 135 ETPs — far more than the US (35).    The largest ETP issuers in Europe last year were the US-based CoinShares, Switzerland’s 21Shares, and London-headquartered ETC Group, according to  Track Insight .   James Burnie, fintech expert at British law firm gunnercooke, told TNW that BlackRock’s entry into Europe’s maturing ETP market is an added boost for the sector. “It gets traditional finance comfortable with dealing in crypto assets,” he said.    “However, given that the crypto markets are now already considered a mainstay of finance, such moves are now becoming less impactful,” he added. “Soon the scrutiny will be more on any large traditional player not being in the industry.”   Habibi echoes Burnie’s sentiments about the sector’s maturity. She argues that BlackRock’s move speaks to a wider trend of “blurring traditional finance with digital assets.”    “Crypto is becoming more aligned with everyday finance,” she said.

Unlike payment request  apps  like Tikkie — ubiquitous in the Netherlands — Cino splits bills in real-time, so you don’t have to chase down your mates to cough up on that exorbitant sushi bill you covered last week.         Cino is available across the EU but, fuelled by fresh  funding , the startup will now expand to the UK.

They can then create or join custom payment groups with fully adjustable split ratios. Everyone’s share is then deducted at checkout. Every payment appears in a shared group feed for total transparency, and users can hop in or out of groups anytime.   “ Fintech has always been one-dimensional but we are social creatures,” said  Churilova.  “Our payments should reflect how we actually spend money — together. Back in the cash days, it was simpler. Now that we’ve gone digital, payments need to evolve to keep up.”   Cino said it has seen 100% month-on-month growth in Finland and Italy.

The round follows a raise of  $100M  in credit financing in September and a $110mn equity round in March 2024 — when the startup became a  unicorn . In total, Mews has bagged over $500mn to date, making it one of the Netherlands’ most  cash-flooded scaleups .   Mews was founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr, an ex-hotelier on a mission to transform the way hotels do business. “Digital transformation is challenging for many hospitality brands because too many run their systems with legacy, on-premise technology,” Valtr previously told TNW.   Mews has built a  cloud-based  system that helps hotels and other hospitality businesses handle tasks like booking rooms, checking guests in and out, processing payments, and managing housekeeping. It also provides tools for reporting and analytics.   The company is riding  sustained growth  in global travel to fuel its expansion. Mews reported 50% year-on-year growth in 2024, processing more than $10bn in payments volume and surpassing $200mn in revenue. It has also acquired 12 companies in total at it looks to swallow up market share. The most recent acquisitions include Sweden’s Atomize, a cloud-based revenue management system for hotels, and Germany’s HS/3 Hotelsoftware.   Mews plans to continue its shopping spree, aiming for up to four acquisitions in 2025. Fuelled by fresh funding, it’s also looking to expand its presence in the US. It’s no surprise then that the main investor in this latest capital raise was American investment firm Tiger Global.   “Tiger Global is a compelling partner for the next chapter of our journey,” said Valtr. “Their experience with high-growth technology companies and category winners in the US, including Toast, Procore and ServiceTitan, is invaluable as we continue to expand our footprint, accelerate innovation, and pursue strategic acquisitions.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

Musk’s role in the White House had already been linked to Tesla  sales and stock tanking . Now, the repercussions appear to have spread to SpaceX.   The fallout centres on the company’s Starlink satellite internet service.   The network has provided a vital communications system to Ukraine’s military since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. But concerns are now growing that the service could soon be disrupted.

View the Speakers                       According to  Reuters , US officials recently raised the prospect of cutting off Kyiv’s access to Starlink. Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, refuted the report. Nonetheless,  his control  over Ukraine’s connectivity has caused growing alarm. The anxieties have escalated as he and Trump have become  increasingly critical  of the country’s government.   Amid the rising tensions, European satellite internet providers have proposed replacing Starlink with their own systems.   Europe’s rivals to Starlink and Tesla   On Tuesday, Franco-British rival Eutelsat said it was in talks with the EU about extending its internet service to Ukraine. By the day’s end, shares in the company were up  by 77% .   As the stock surged, French satellite firm Thales fired another apparent warning about Starlink. Speaking at a results briefing on Tuesday,  Thales CEO Patrice Cain  pointed to the risks of governments relying on certain network providers.   “Government actors need reliability, visibility and stability,”  Caine  said .  “A player that — as we have seen from time to time — mixes up economic rationale and political motivation is not the kind that would reassure certain clients.”   Similar concerns have been raised about Musk’s impact on Tesla. Capitalising on the blowback from his political moves, Swedish EV maker Polestar offered Tesla owners a discount on leases for its latest SUV.   Jordan Hofmann, head of sales for Polestar US, said the response had been “incredible.”   “This week saw some of the highest order days for Polestar 3”, he wrote on LinkedIn.   Now, concerns over Starlink may have created another opening for Musk’s competitors.

Frequently, the findings are disheartening.   This week, one report estimated that female founders in Europe secured just 12% of last year’s total VC funding. Another calculated that overlooking  women-led  deep tech firms over the past decade cost the economy  €198.8bn .   Yet there are also reasons for optimism. One is that the investment landscape is showing signs of progress. According to the  Female Innovation Index , last year saw a 7% increase in round size and a 15% rise in M&A activity for tech firms founded by women.   Another source of hope is the transformative technologies emerging from their companies. As IWD approaches, we spoke to four women propelling powerful innovations in TNW’s home country, the Netherlands, about their work — and why the tech sector must do more for gender equity.   Anne Berends, co-founder and CTO at SunLED Life Science   Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI, Monzo & Datasnipper Check out the NEW speakers for TNW Conference 2025 on June 19 & 20.                           View the Speakers                         Anne Berends has a rare blend of academic expertise and business nous. As a materials scientist and program director at Dutch LED pioneer Seaborough, she substantiated a compelling hypothesis: near-infrared light can improve our health and well-being.   Under her watch, the idea grew into a new spin-off company: SunLED Life Science. As the co-founder and CTO, Berends shapes the technological and strategic direction of the business.   She makes a clear case for supporting women in tech.   “Half of the population is female, and girls consistently outperform boys in school,” she says. “The reality is that while there are countless women with brilliant, entrepreneurial ideas, they remain underrepresented in the startup world. This isn’t just a diversity issue; it’s a missed opportunity. When female founders are rare, valuable innovation and economic potential are left untapped.”   To unlock this talent, she continues,  funding  access must improve.   “It’s time for VCs and [private equity] firms to recognise this and actively invest in the next generation of women-led venture — because the talent is there, waiting to be unlocked.”   Kiki Lauwers, CEO at Thorizon     Like Berends, Kiki Lauwers has a glittering  resume  of business and scientific  credentials.  She holds a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology and an MBA from INSEAD.   After working at McKinsey, online retailer bol.com, and audiovisual  business  Kinly, she joined deep tech scaleup Thorizon as CEO in 2023. The company is developing a nuclear reactor with an unusual power source: molten salt. The approach could realise the dream of sustainable, and green nuclear energy.   Lauwers sees two sides to her position as a woman leader in tech.   “Being ‘different’ has its advantages — people remember you, and with all-male panels fading out, I get more opportunities to speak. But I also have to fight bias. I’m not here because I’m a woman; I’m here despite it,” she says.   “Every day, I push against biases that I’m less technical, smart, persistent, or experienced. In a recent interview I was quoted as the ‘Belgian woman, and my peer was quoted as the ‘engineer from Delft’. I am an engineer with an MBA degree, a former strategy consultant with a lot of management experience, but sometimes, I do wonder if securing funding would be easier if my name were Peter.”   Beyond the ethical issues, Lauwers emphasises the business argument for greater equality.   “Europe’s deep tech sector needs all the talent it can get, which means encouraging more women to pursue STEM and highlighting engineering role models,” she says. “I’m proud that Thorizon has over 30% female employees.”   Esther Bisschop, co-founder at Th3rd     Esther Bisschop is an entrepreneur with a flair for storytelling. She deployed these skills to turn her startup — Th3rd — into a global leader in 3D scanning software.   Th3rd’s digital models were a hit with clothing brands. Social media giants also recognised the tech’s value. In 2022, Snap acquired the Amsterdam-based business as part of a drive to embed AR into e-commerce.   Bisschop points to the societal benefits of diversity in tech.   “The world’s most pressing challenges won’t be solved by a select few, they require all of us. To build a better future, we need founders of different genders, backgrounds, ages, and cultures to drive  innovation ,” she says.   “Investing in women founders isn’t just about fairness, it’s about unlocking the full potential of entrepreneurship.”   Lea Milovich, CEO and co-founder at FlowBeams     Lea Milovich has over 15 years of experience as a senior  business development manager , team leader, and startup coach. In 2021, she added “founder” to her extensive list of professional achievements.   The company she built — FlowBeams — began with the idea of applying tattoos without needles. The concept  evolved  into a non-invasive injection system for cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments.   Milovich highlights the benefits of being a woman leader.   “Being a female founder means navigating uncharted waters with hidden and declared biases. However, for me it has brought a unique perspective where resilience drives innovation much stronger,” she says.   “I truly believe that, to unlock the potential of the tech ecosystem, we must actively invest in brave and brilliant women that are willing to risk their time and reputation, not as a gesture, but as a strategic imperative.”   This year’s TNW Conference features a  Women in Tech ticket . The pass provides 50% off access to the event, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.     TNW is also hosting a Female Founders’ Brunch on March 15.

Bliro uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to extract relevant information from in-person or virtual conversations. It then generates structured meeting notes and automates follow-up tasks. So far, pretty standard.    However, unlike popular transcription tools like Otter, Fireflies, or Notta, Bliro isn’t a bot that hops onto your call, records an audio file, and then transcribes it. Instead, the platform transcribes in real-time, ensuring that no audio recordings of conversations are ever created.    This guarantees compliance with strict privacy and  security  requirements like GDPR, the company said. That also means you don’t need the other party’s consent to record, streamlining the note-taking process.    3 free tickets to TNW Conference? Get them now!

For those transcripts that do contain personal information like names, the company “prioritises compliance” at every step, Schweitzer added.   Schweitzer co-founded Bliro in 2022 alongside data scientist Martin Thoma, as a privacy-first transcription tool, spun out from AI research at the Technical University of Munich.    In addition to eschewing the recording process, Bliro encrypts all data processed in the app and stores it on servers in Frankfurt. It does not share data with third parties, including its own employees, without explicit consent. Nor does it use user data to refine its  AI  models, the company said.   “Many large companies avoid recording-based solutions due to privacy and compliance concerns — making Bliro the only viable option for them,” said Schweitzer.   Bliro targets customer-facing teams who use the app to automate meeting transcriptions, generate AI-driven summaries, and create follow-up actions — while maintaining  privacy  and compliance. The app currently supports 15 languages.    Today, Bliro announ ced it has raised €2.8mn in a funding round led by German early-stage VC LEA Partners, with participation from 468 Capital and Dutch seed investor Rockstart. Bliro also launched its iOS app, which transcribes and analyses face-to-face conversations.   The new funding will be used to accelerate product development and win more customers. Schweitzer said more than 1,000 companies already use Bliro, including well-known German brands such as ImmoScout24, OMR, and Telefónica Germany.

In her latest business move, Williams has backed French startup WeWard.   WeWard is a free app that offers real-world rewards for walking. It tracks your steps and lets you earn points (called “Wards”), which can be exchanged for gift cards, donations, or discounts. The goal is to encourage people to be more active while benefiting from their daily movement.   Williams has invested an undisclosed sum in the company and will also act as an ambassador. WeWard, meanwhile, has committed to donating $25,000 to her charity, CARE, and will host a month-long “Venus Williams Championship” where users can unlock up to $40,000 in donations by reaching step milestones.    “A large part of staying well and active is simply by moving your body whichever way you can, and with WeWard, walking becomes a fun and rewarding experience,” said Williams, whose portfolio also includes French social investing app Shares and Pelago, a British startup tackling substance abuse via “virtual clinics.”   Beyond physical rewards, users can collect virtual trading cards — dubbed WeCards — placed at specific locations on the map, a bit like Pokémon Go. Users can compete with friends or join virtual leagues, tracking their progress on leaderboards and earning gold, silver, or bronze medals based on activity levels.    The idea is to incentivise people to walk further and more often — and it seems to be working. Approximately 6.5 million WeCards are collected daily by the roughly 20 million people who use the app, the company said.   Walking plans   WeWard’s CEO, Yves Benchimol, founded the startup in 2019 alongside Nicolas Hardy and Tanguy de la Villegeorges. The company is almost completely bootstrapped, save for a few hundred thousand euros in seed funding raised in 2020.    While WeWard has not raised much capital itself, it has handed plenty of money out. To date, the company has given $20mn in cash back to users and $1mn to charity partners, it claims.   WeWard generates revenue through retail partnerships, advertising, and features like “Playtime,” where users can earn additional rewards by engaging with third-party mobile games directly through the app.    WeWard is just one of a cohort of pro-walking fitness startups.  Rivals include Walk15 , a Lithuanian company that’s trialled its  tech  with public healthcare services. Walk15’s co-founder and CEO, Vlada Musvydaitė-Vilciauske, told TNW last year that she wants to create “a pharmacy for walking.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

In many ways, firms like Apple, Google, and Meta are the gatekeepers of this sensitive information. But what happens when the authorities come knocking? It appears that Silicon Valley often rolls over and complies.    Over the last 10 years, Apple, Google, and Meta have h anded over data on 3.1 million accounts to the US government,  according to a new report by Swiss software company Proton.    The number of times officials have requested user data from Big Tech has skyrocketed by an average of 600% over the same timeframe, Proton found. Meta’s data sharing surged by 675%, marking the largest increase, followed by Apple at 621% and Google at 530%.   Apple, Google, and Meta comply with between 80-90% of US government data requests, according to Proton. This  potentially includes handing over user emails, files, messages, and other highly personal information.    Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI, Monzo & Datasnipper Check out the NEW speakers for TNW Conference 2025 on June 19 & 20.                           View the Speakers                       While data requests also saw an uptick from countries including Germany, France, and the UK, the US took the lion’s share.   “All that’s required for the government to find out just about everything it could ever need is a request message to Big Tech in California,” said Raphael Auphan, COO of Proton. “And as long as Big Tech refuses to implement widespread end-to-end encryption, these massive, private data reserves will remain open to abuse.”   Data sharing with US authorities has surged since 2014. Credit: Proton   Government desires for data   Proton — best known for its products ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, and ProtonDrive — has long positioned itself as a privacy-first alternative to Big Tech firms. However, the company also complies with its fair share of government requests for user data.    According to Proton’s own  transparency report ,  it received 13 data requests from Swiss authorities back in 2017, soaring to 6,378 by 2024. Of those, it complied with 5,971 of the requests. That’s 93% — higher than the Big Tech companies highlighted in the new report.    However,  unlike Silicon Valley’s giants, Proton encrypts emails, files, and VPN traffic in a way that even the company itself cannot read or access. So, even if authorities demand data, there’s very little it can provide.     “In no circumstances can we share emails, files, contact lists, calendar entries or other personal content,” a Proton spokesperson told TNW. “We cannot share what we do not have.”   Moreover, Proton operates under strict Swiss privacy laws, which means foreign governments cannot request data from it without first going through Swiss courts, adding an extra layer of security for users.    But under specific circumstances, the company can hand over metadata  about the account, including IP address, email address, and recipient emails .   “Proton is dedicated to protecting user privacy but that does not mean it’s a safe haven for illegal activity,” the spokesperson said. “Proton is subject to national laws and has legal obligations, to which we are obliged to comply unless we have legal grounds to contest, which does not happen very often in Switzerland.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

That’s a 22% premium over the delivery app’s recent three-month high but only a fifth of its pandemic-era peak of above €100 per share. Following the announcement, Just Eat Takeaway’s shares  climbed   53% on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange this morning.   Just Eat Takeaway was formed in 2020 through the merger of UK-based Just Eat and Dutch company Takeaway.com. The €7.4bn  deal  made the Amsterdam-based company — which has been both a speaker and partner at TNW Conference — one of the world’s largest food delivery platforms.   However, it’s been a turbulent few years for Just Eat Takeaway since then, amid cooling demand and tough competition from rivals. The company also had a few missteps, most notably its botched takeover of US delivery app Grubhub. Just Eat Takeaway acquired Grubhub for  $7.3bn in 2021 only to  sell it off  for $650mn just three years later.    Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       For Prosus, the deal is an opportunity to turn Just Eat Takeaway into a “European tech champion,” said its CEO, Fabricio Bloisi.   The Prosus plan for Just Eat Takeaway   Prosus already owns iFood, Latin America’s largest food delivery platform. The firm also has stakes in Germany’s Delivery Hero, Chinese shopping platform Meituan, and Swiggy, a grocery delivery app in India.   Prosus has wanted to add Just Eat Takeaway to its delivery empire for years. The South African-owned firm  tried to hijack the merger of Just Eat and Takeaway.com in 2019 with a  £5.1bn (€6.1bn) bid .       Just Eat Takeaway announced the deal today alongside its annual results, reporting a 35% jump in pre-tax profits for 2024, reaching €460mn. Jitse Groen, the company’s CEO, said it was “now a faster growing, more profitable, and predominantly European-based business.”   Groen hopes that Prosus’ expertise in the delivery sector and AI technology will bring further profits for Just Eat Takeaway.     “Prosus fully supports our strategic plans, and its extensive resources will help to further accelerate our investments and growth across food, groceries, fintech and other adjacencies,” said Groen.     Just Eat Takeaway confirmed that its current leadership would remain in place under the agreement, which is still subject to shareholder approval.    If the deal is approved by shareholders and the relevant authorities, it will be one of the largest acquisitions of a Dutch tech company in history.    Other notable buyouts in the country include Warburg Pincus and Apax Partners’ €5.1bn acquisition of T-Mobile Netherlands in 2021 and Siemens’ €628mn purchase of Rotterdam-based software startup Mendix in 2018.  US chip maker Qualcomm’s $44bn attempt to acquire its Dutch rival NXP in 2018 would’ve been by far the largest buy, but it  fell through  after failing to win approval from Chinese regulators.

New registrations of Tesla vehicles plummeted across Europe last month amid widespread  boycotts  against the EV brand. While broader economic forces are at  play, Musk’s role in the Trump administration and his open support of  far-right politicians  appears to be fuelling his company’s precipitous fall from grace — and gifting rival brands a golden opportunity.   Germany’s transport authority  reported  that new Tesla registrations in January fell by nearly 60% year-on-year. That’s despite the country’s  battery-electric vehicles sector seeing a combined 53.5% growth  in sales  last month.   Dramatic declines in registrations were also  reported  in Spain (75.4%), France (63.4%), Sweden (46%), and the Netherlands (42.5%). The dip has been linked to the behaviour of Tesla’s CEO.   “There is no doubt that ‘the Musk factor’ has influenced Tesla’s sales in the same way as his reputation impacted Twitter when he bought it and rebranded it as X,” Andrew Fellows, an automotive industry expert at Star, a global tech consultancy, tells TNW. The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!   Musk, an already divisive figure, has gone on a MAGA rampage in recent months, with the world’s richest man — and the  social media platform  X, which he owns — fast becoming a mouthpiece for Trump-era conservatism.      In Europe, Musk has openly endorsed Germany’s populist AfD, even hosting an interview on X where he  heaped praise  on the party’s leader Alice Weidel. At the Trump inauguration on January 20, Musk made a controversial hand gesture, which many interpreted as a Nazi-style salute.    Musk’s actions are either despicable or courageous, depending on whom you ask. But for those who deplore his actions, Tesla — a brand hard to set apart from its leader — is an obvious target.    The backlash against Tesla   On January 23, political campaigners  beamed  an image of Musk  making the Nazi-like salute  along with the word “Heil” onto Tesla’s gigafactory in Berlin.   After Musk  joined an AfD rally by video call  in late January, Poland’s Tourism Minister Slawomir Nitras called for a  boycott of  the EV brand. In early February, a Tesla showroom in the Netherlands was  defaced  with swastikas and anti-fascist slogans.      Tesla Gigafactory, Berlin   (In collaboration with  @politicalbeauty )  pic.twitter.com/xwRUiYX03p   — Led By Donkeys (@ByDonkeys)  January 22, 2025     It’s not hard to argue that public sentiment against Musk is souring. However, whether the entrepreneur’s actions are hurting Tesla’s bottom line is harder to measure.    One of the best ways to gauge that is to ask Tesla owners.    In the Netherlands,  one  in  three  Tesla drivers want to get rid of their car because of Musk, according to a recent  survey . One such individual is Tim Kraaijvanger, the founder of Tesla360.nl, a Dutch site dedicated entirely to Tesla products. In an ironic twist, Kraaijvanger recently sold his Tesla and bought a Polestar instead.    “I do not wish to be associated with [Musk’s] ideology,” he told  Wired . “While Musk might get away with a [Nazi-like] salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behaviour.”   Musk’s antics could be good news for other EV-makers, as more people like  Kraaijvanger jump ship.  “It’s a fantastic opportunity for rival manufacturers,” says Fellows.    Among those poised to take advantage is Polestar,  the Swedish EV brand.  Polestar’s CEO Michael Lohscheller said that the company has seen a spike in enquiries from disgruntled Tesla owners in recent months — and he’s encouraging his salespeople to target them.   “We get a lot of people writing that they don’t like all this,” Lohscheller told  Bloomberg News . “It’s important to listen closely to what they say. And I can tell you, a lot of people have very, very negative sentiment.”   Some drivers, not yet ready to part with their Tesla, have begun attaching stickers to their cars bearing messages such as,  “I bought this car before Elon went crazy.” Even some of Tesla’s employees want to distance themselves from their boss, according to the  Washington Post .    As of today, Tesla stock has fallen 15% in the last month.    “Tesla is developing a serious reputational problem,” says Fellows. The automotive industry expert believes  Musk and Trump share around 30% of the blame for   the EV maker’s sales decline. He attributes the remaining 70% to “industry factors.”   The blame game   Tesla’s  Model Y was  Europe’s best-selling car  in 2023 , but intense competition has challenged the brand’s market share. In 2024, Tesla’s sales  declined  by 1.1%, its first drop in over 10 years. In September, Chinese automaker BYD became the world’s leading EV brand, thanks to its aggressive pricing strategy.     While Tesla has made modest changes to its lineup in the past few years, rival brands like VW, Renault, and BMW have been rolling out new models, sometimes with  lower prices .       Tesla has also been subject to many of the same challenges as other  EV  makers — slowing demand, supply chain shocks, and decreased subsidies for first-time buyers. But the company also has some unique issues of its own.     “Tesla was already facing several headwinds in 2025 before CEO Elon Musk found himself at the centre of several controversies with the potential to impact the company’s sales volume and profitability,” Peter McNally, senior analyst at London-headquartered research firm Third Bridge, tells TNW.      Musk’s firm has also been busy updating its Model Y, which McNally believes contributed to the sales drop as customers wait for the latest model before upgrading. The refreshed Model Y is set to  go on sale  in the US next month.   Musk’s antics couldn’t have come at a worse time for Tesla, as it grapples with intense competition, an ageing model lineup, and a wider slump in demand for electric vehicles.    Tesla’s reputation in Europe now largely hinges on its CEO — unless the company decides to   oust him .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

One company cashing in is University of Oxford spinout OrganOx, which this week secured $142mn in funding to fuel its expansion in the US as it mulls a potential IPO.       OrganOx’s Metra machine pumps oxygenated blood and nutrients through the liver, mimicking natural conditions during a transplant. This helps the organ stay healthier for up to 12 hours longer than traditional methods — giving doctors more time to find a suitable recipient and improving transplant success rates.  To date, the technology has been used in more than 5,000 transplant operations.    OrganOx isn’t the only player disrupting organ preservation, which has relied on one technique —  static cold storage  — for decades.    Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       Across the pond, Paragonix Technologies has developed an organ transportation device that preserves organs by cooling them and then pumping a special preservation solution through them. This helps to keep the organ cells alive and reduces damage during transport or storage, ensuring the organ stays viable for transplant. The  tech  caught the eye of Swedish medical-equipment giant Getinge, which acquired Paragonix for $477mn last year.    Meanwhile, US biotech scaleup eGenesis, founded in 2015, has raised  $456 mn to advance xenotransplantation — using CRISPR gene-editing techniques to develop human-compatible organs derived from pigs. Yes, you read that correctly: pig organs for human transplants.    Last year, s urgeons at the University of Pennsylvania successfully attached one of eGenesis’ genetically-altered pig livers to a brain-dead person. The organ functioned normally for 72 hours. The team used OrganOx’s machine to carry out the transplant.  The endeavor aims to address the  chronic shortage  of donor organs from humans, potentially saving countless lives.       In December 2024, there were over 104,000 people in the US  waiting for an organ donor . Every day,  17 people die waiting.    Craig Marshall, CEO of OrganOx, said that the company is preparing to launch clinical trials for new devices designed to assist kidney transplants, as well as advance its work in genetically-engineered pig livers.    Other companies are taking organ transplantation into the realm of science fiction — and raising some ethical questions in the process. Renewal Bio, a  startup  from Israel, is using cutting-edge stem-cell science to create synthetic human embryos. The company wants to use the embryos — grown in an artificial womb — as a source for harvesting cells and tissues for medical applications, such as organ transplants.    While Renewal Bio insists that these entities are not intended to develop into human beings, the potential for creating embryos that resemble people raises ethical questions about the limits of scientific experimentation.

Ireland’s  Orreco  will cross the Atlantic with a trove of athletic performance software, while Iceland’s Oz Sports will bring an AI-driven camera system.    On arrival, the duo will join Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech, a six-month accelerator.    During the programme, the companies will tap into expertise from various industry leaders. Among them are Comcast broadcasting networks NBC Sports, Sky Sports, and the Golf Channel from Comcast’s broadcasting empire. Further support will come from a star-studded squad of partners, including the Premier League, the PGA Tour, and NASCAR.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       The diverse lineup of  experts is  a key selling point.   On a video call from Comcast’s headquarters in Philadelphia, Jenna Kurath, Head of Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech, said the programme is “powered by partnerships.”   “By bringing the best of innovation into our organisation, forging those strategic relationships with emerging startups, and working alongside some of the most elite sports organisations in the world, we’re able to really push us beyond the status quo,” Kurath told TNW.   The collaborative approach has one overall target: cultivating a new generation of sports tech. But for the teams involved, the attractions are varied.   The selected teams receive new routes to accelerate product development, forge industry relationships, and refine commercial strategies. Their partners gain access to emerging technologies that could enhance future broadcasts and sporting events.   Comcast, meanwhile, can get an edge on market trends, strengthen partnerships, unlock new revenue streams, and enhance customer experiences. The company is also investing in startups selected for the programme.   Inside the programme   The potential benefits have proved alluring for startups. Over 1,600 teams applied to this year’s programme. The cohort was then whittled down to just 10 companies.   Kurath breaks down the selection process into three key criteria. “The first is, is it a problem we’re solving? The second is, do we have a line of sight on how we’ll test and pilot that technology over the six-month programme and beyond? But probably most important of all is, is this the team that we believe can do it — and is this the team we want to work alongside?”   Orreco impressed the selectors with an AI sports analytics platform. The software interprets camera data, blood biomarkers, GPS, and other data sources. It then provides personalised insights on performance, nutrition, training, sleep, and recovery.   OZ Sports, meanwhile, earned a spot on the roster after developing an AI-driven, multi-camera 4K60p HDR production unit for broadcasting. The system offers remote sports coverage in top-notch quality — at a fraction of the price.   With Comcast recently winning new rights to NBA and Premier League games, the system could support the expanded coverage. “This is a really cost-effective, efficient way for us to do that and make it the best broadcast experience,” Kurath said.   Orreco and Oz Sports join a range of European companies that have entered the programme.   Europe’s sports tech roster   One recent European graduate is the UK’s Kymira, which developed infrared-infused recovery apparel for the  Philadelphia Flyers  ice hockey team. The gear was initially built for the players, but the benefits have also been tested on front office staff.   Another alumnus is Manchester -based Dizplay, meanwhile, makes sports fans active participants in the spectator experience. In partnership with Sky Sports, the startup introduced a “Viewer’s Verdict” for boxing broadcasts, allowing audiences to share real-time opinions and enhance social commentary. This technology could also expand beyond sports, bringing interactivity to live news, talk shows, and other broadcasts.   A third British graduate, Tickets for Good, provides a platform that offers discounted tickets to tailored audiences. That could mean sports fans, but it could also serve teachers or first responders.    “We’re always looking for companies that are proving themselves in the grand stage of sports, but when they have extensibility into other areas of our business, it’s just all the more powerful,” Kurath said.   For European members of the programme, t he accelerator offers a springboard to the world’s biggest market.   “A lot of the international companies are very strong within their own specific country, but are looking to break into the US market,” Kurath said.    “It is huge, it is nuanced. It is not an easy market. The sports industry is not an easy one to break into, so we’re opening doors for them and giving them really deep customer insights on what it means for your technology to succeed in the US market.”   Enterprise innovation is one of three key themes at   TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

The EU is going “overboard on tech regulation,” said Job van der Voort, CEO and founder of Remote, an HR tech company valued at over $3bn. “It’s stifling innovation and it’s a massive risk for Europe.”   Van der Voort told TNW that many business leaders share his view. “Most entrepreneurs agree this is a huge problem,” he said.     Indeed, such concerns are being raised with growing frequency.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       At a conference in Paris  earlier this month , the likes of Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch and DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis repeatedly  called for regulation in Europe that is “flexible enough” to support innovation and competitiveness.   A little over a week later, Dutch software unicorn Bird took drastic steps to escape “overregulation,” announcing  plans to move most of its operations  out of Europe .   “I think more companies will be forced to do the same [as Bird],” said van der Voort. “But the biggest impact will be at the early stage.”   The founder highlighted the  ongoing trend  of European startups crossing the Atlantic to scale. Research by London-based VC  Hoxton Ventures found that nearly all European startups with over $500mn in revenue — including Spotify, Wise, and Adyen — succeeded by winning the US market.    Van der Voort believes  burdensome tech regulation is encouraging moves beyond the continent. “It’s becoming unattractive to start and maintain a business here,” he said. “That’s why I tell startups to leave Europe if they want to succeed.”   Van der Voort has followed his own advice. After he and Marcelo Lebre founded Remote in 2019, the partners decided to base the company in San Francisco. “ It was simply easier to start it there,” he said.   Remote, which helps businesses hire and manage remote teams, has grown rapidly since then. In 2022, the company raised $300mn in a Series C round that pushed its valuation above $3bn.    “The EU needs to consider its own fate over the next decades,” warned  van der Voort . “Regulation standing in the way of innovation — that makes it harder for startups and is incredibly hurtful for the economy.”      Job van der Voort is a former speaker at   TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

Bird’s main product is a cloud-based platform that manages customer communications across messaging apps, calls, video, SMS, and email. The company also recently launched a new “AI employee” chatbot, which handles tasks such as responding to customer inquiries, qualifying leads, and providing personalised support.     Vis is now looking overseas to fuel the company’s next advances.

It will also open a “meditation, rejuvenation, and health centre” in Thailand for its employees, Vis said in a  LinkedIn post.    Nevertheless, Bird will maintain an office in Lithuania and keep its tax base in the Netherlands for now — so it’s not leaving the EU entirely.    Earlier this month, Bird cut 120 jobs — roughly one-third of its total workforce, which is mainly based in Europe. New  AI  tools contributed to the staff cuts, said Vis, but it was also an effort to “ position our teams closer to our customers” in the “Americas and Asia,” he told  TechCrunch .     The news comes as the EU pushes ahead with its landmark AI Act, which   entered force   last year. The act lays out a rulebook for governing AI based on risk levels, designed to ensure the technology is deployed safely, transparently, and ethically.      The US, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction. While the EU imposes strict rules, the Trump administration is removing AI restrictions and giving tech sector leaders such as Elon Musk prominent roles in government.    “There is no stopping this technology whether we like it or not,” said Vis. “Whatever the future will hold — if you want to compete you need to be liberal not restrictive.”   Robert Vis is a former speaker at   TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

This type of reactor uses complex, twisted magnetic fields to confine hot plasma, creating the conditions needed for fusion reactions.   “ Stellaris is designed to operate in continuous mode and be intrinsically stable,” Francesco Sciortino, Proxima’s co-founder and CEO, told TNW. “No other fusion power plant design has yet been demonstrated to be capable of that.”       Stellaris’ design builds on the  Wendelstein 7-X , the world’s largest stellarator, located at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany. While Wendelstein 7-X was developed for research, Stellaris could one day power the grid.    3 free tickets to TNW Conference? Get them now!

Alpha will be the first-ever fusion device demonstrating net energy production in a steady state, said Sciortino. The machine will lay the foundation for Proxima’s first 1GW fusion reactor, which the company hopes will power up sometime in the 2030s.    Stellarators have several advantages over their more popular cousin, the tokamak (the type adopted by   ITER mega project   under construction in France). They need less power to operate and are more stable. Their biggest drawback is complexity — stellarators are notoriously hard to design and build. This is why they were largely set aside in the 1960s for the tokamak. However, advances in computational power are closing the gap.   An AI-enabled fusion reactor design   Similar to other industries like automotive or   aerospace ,  Proxima uses  AI  supercomputers to rapidly iterate the best fusion reactor designs based on key parameters like cost, material availability, and efficiency. So instead of having to build multiple prototypes, Proxima can jump straight into building a functioning demonstrator.    “The understanding of complex geometry and its consequences is everything in stellarators,” said Sciortino. “AI is helping Proxima to uncover patterns that lead to simpler, faster, and cheaper designs.”    Stellaris is designed to generate more power per unit volume than any previous stellarator. HTS magnets create stronger magnetic fields, allowing for smaller, faster-to-build, and more efficient reactors. This approach also reduces costs in both construction and operation. Stellaris uses only existing materials, making it buildable with today’s supply chains, the company said. Full details of the reactor were published today in the journal  Fusion Engineering and Design.   The renders of Stellaris feature a unique twisting design.

The institute focuses exclusively on fusion and has more plasma physicists than MIT.   Proxima   raised €20mn in funding   last year as it looks to turn the mind-bending physics of fusion into a viable business.       “When Proxima started its journey, the founders said, ‘This is possible, we’ll prove it to you,’ and they did,” said Ian Hogarth, a partner at Plural, one of Proxima Fusion’s earliest investors. “Stellaris positions QI-HTS stellarators as the leading technology in the global race to commercial fusion.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

However, the Netherlands provides a minor bright spot, according to a new report by PwC.      More than 3,000 companies worldwide have reached unicorn status since 2013, collectively reaching a staggering valuation of $27 trillion, according to the study. The US accounts for 55% of these and a whopping 75% of their total valuation.     In stark contrast, the EU has contributed just 9% of billion-dollar startups and generated 4% of global unicorn value in that timeframe.    Despite the bloc’s poor performance, the Netherlands punches above its weight, ranking as the fourth-largest unicorn hub in the EU.      Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       The country has produced 32 unicorns, with 72% still active. Most emerged between 2018 and 2022, mirroring global trends.    The majority of the active flock have engaged with TNW’s services. Among them are Ayden,  Bird ,  Bunq ,  Booking.com , and  Picnic .     Overall, Dutch unicorns account for 11% of the EU total, ranking behind Germany, France, and Sweden. Amsterdam alone hosts 7% of all unicorns in the bloc.   The Netherlands has also done better than most at attracting unicorns to relocate. Five billion-dollar  startups  have migrated to the country. Only one unicorn has left for the US.     In contrast, 64 unicorns have left the EU (excluding the Netherlands) while only 10 startups have entered from outside its borders.    The data was released just days after a  worrying report  on the Dutch tech ecosystem. The new findings provides a glimmer of hope for the Netherlands, but also raises concerns.   Like the rest of the EU, the country lags far behind the US in fostering high-growth companies, even after adjusting for economic size, population, and venture capital availability.    New tips on breeding unicorns   There are four primary reasons why the US remains the preferred playground for billion-dollar startups, according to PwC.   First, venture capital intensity (as a share of GDP) is significantly higher in the US than in Europe — 0.7% compared to just 0.2%.    Second, regulatory fragmentation is causing disruption. Differences in language, local business conditions, and the lack of an integrated capital or banking union can impede growth.    Third, the sheer size and uniformity of the US domestic market provide a competitive edge. Finally, companies often move stateside to access a deeper talent pool.   If the EU wants to close the unicorn gap, PwC advises the bloc to act decisively. Increasing venture capital investment, streamlining regulations, and fostering a more integrated single market could help startups scale faster.

View the Speakers                       Corpora has shared an array of the results. They range from analyses of  autism  and  AI investments  to reports on documentaries about the  Roswell incident . Links to sources are provided throughout every text.   “We’re a research engine — we’re not a search engine,” Morris said. “The breadth and depth of what we produce and look at is really important.”   Morris shared news of Corpora’s public release exclusively with TNW.   The announcement marks another milestone in his colourful career.   Behind the AI research engine   A self-made tycoon who left school at 16, Morris is the former chairman of  Candy Crush  creator King. When the company went public in 2014, Morris became one of Britain’s richest men.  A further windfall flowed from his dating website uDate, which he sold for around $150mn.   An ill-fated spell running Derby County Football Club bit a painful chunk out of his fortunes, but Morris remains a wealthy man. Last August, he placed in the top 10 of the first-ever  Sunday Times   Gaming Rich List .   A substantial slice of his funds is now going into Corpora.ai.   Corpora.ai vs OpenAI   Alongside the launch announcement, Morris revealed that he’s invested $15mn of his own money into Corpora.   His funding aims to create a new business model for LLMs. Rather than challenge the leading GenAI firms, Corpora plans to bring a new service to the sector. The research engine can also integrate existing models on the market.   “We don’t compete with OpenAI, Google, or DeepSeek,” Morris said. “The nice thing is, we can play with all of these AI vendors quite nicely. As they improve their models, our output gets better. It’s a really great symbiotic relationship.”   Those outputs are where Corpora plans to make its mark.

I must not have heard her the first two times. I’d been drumming on the desk again, using my fingers for sticks and the floor beneath for a kick drum. While my body was in maths class, my mind was elsewhere.     It was 1970. I was John Bonham, drummer of legendary rock band Led Zeppelin, on stage at the Royal Albert Hall, performing “Moby Dick” — one of the most iconic drum solos of all time. The lights are low, the atmosphere electric, and I’m thundering along, each beat pulling the crowd deeper into my rhythmic spell.   These kinds of daydreams happened a lot. More than my teacher, and my parents, would have liked. But that didn’t stop me. Drumming was my creative outlet, an escape from the whirlwind of adolescence — and maths, of course.     Back then, the ultimate form of musical immersion was playing drums to my favourite tunes. For that, you had to get your hands on drumless tracks. This way you wouldn’t just  play  with your favourite drummer — you could  become  your favourite drummer.     The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! But in the early 2000s, removing drums from a song was almost impossible. The only option was to get your hands on an original recording of the band playing the song without drums. There were a few of these tracks scattered across the web or recorded on CDs, but only for the most popular songs. This technological impasse forced me, and millions of others, into the role of backup drummer. If only there were a simple way to remove the drums from any song, I mused…   Fast forward to the present day and my musical dreams have become reality. There are now several apps that use  AI  to separate and remove “stems” — like bass, drums or vocals — from any song. One of them is Moises, founded by Brazilian web developer Geraldo Ramos.    Like me, Ramos is a drummer. Unlike me, he’s also a  tech  whizz.    “I’ve been involved with computers since very young, but I also play the drums,” Ramos tells TNW. “I always had these two tracks in my life: music as a hobby, and then tech as a career. With Moises, I bought the two together.”   Ramos first launched Moises using Spleeter, an open-source AI model created by the research team at French music streaming company Deezer. Spleeter was revolutionary for the time, but it was built for researchers, not musicians. Ramos took the model and used it to create an alpha version of the Moises app. Over 50,000 people signed up within the first week.    “I realised that this was just the tip of the iceberg —  this new generation of tools will be able to change everything, how people create, consume, produce music ,” says Ramos.   Geraldo Ramos, the founder and CEO at Moises   Moises says it now has 50 million registered users on its platform. The  app  is used by amateurs looking to practise their craft. It’s also endorsed by an ensemble of rising stars.     YouTube drummer Jorge Garrido, aka “El Estepario Siberiano”, says the tool is “a total game changer.”   “ Now not only can I play  any  drum part over the songs that I cover but also I can learn any song by extracting the drums out of the original mix,” he tells TNW.   El Estepario, from Valencia, Spain, rose to fame through viral Instagram videos. The drummer, who has over 4.5 million subscribers on YouTube, is one of a cohort of young musicians using technology to perfect their art and reach wider audiences. Increasingly, that includes using artificial intelligence.   “Tools like AI are just making things easier,” he says. “ You no longer require a PhD in mastering to be able to master nor do you need a PhD in audio engineering to separate the instruments on a song. Technology is the new democracy for artists.”    You judge the results in this clip of El Estepario in action:     How does AI separate drums from a song?   Moises’ developers train their machine learning algorithms on thousands of stems so that the AI can learn to recognise the unique frequencies and rhythms of each instrument. Over time, it gets better at identifying and separating these sounds from mixed audio, even when they overlap.    Once the AI isolates and removes an instrument, it fills in the space by reconstructing the remaining audio, smoothing over any gaps to make it sound seamless.   While Moises got its break with song separation,  it has since developed a whole suite of AI tools aimed at helping musicians practise. One of these tools picks up the beat of any song and then adds a metronome to it. Another for guitarists can automatically detect the chords of any track.    Moises is also working on a generative AI toolset to launch later this year that can create an entirely original stem for you.    While Moises designed the first version of its app using Deezer’s Spleeter, it now has a team of data scientists building AI models in-house.   According to the company, all the algorithms are trained on licensed music from studio houses and compositions created by producers in Moises’ studios.   Ramos says the company is committed to “ethical AI.”    “Ninety percent of our team are musicians,” he says. “We’re not trying to replace real music but enhance it.”    The good and bad of AI for music   In recent years, AI has faced significant scrutiny in creative industries over concerns ranging from copyright infringement to job losses.    Last year, a band of US record labels sued  Suno and Udio, two of the most prominent AI music generators, alleging copyright infringement on a “massive scale.”     Udio’s and Suno’s tools allow users to produce entire songs by typing in written descriptions. The companies claim their use of copyrighted material falls under “fair use,” a  common defence  from AI companies.   Aside from allegations that AI companies are ripping off original works, some worry that using algorithms to generate music risks replacing the vital human element that makes every piece of art unique.    “ I’m fascinated and horrified in equal measure,” British new wave artist Gary Numan told Blitzed Magazine in an  interview  last month. “I fully expect Al to write great songs. There will be Al pop stars and actors who will become as popular, if not more so, than any human. We will go to shows where the stars are Al but appear on stage just the same. Everything is about to change.”   But Numan does believe that human creativity will endure. “I think for quite some time the world will be amazed and entertained by all the wonders Al will create in the arts. But, ultimately, if we survive long enough, I hope and suspect that people will slowly return to human-created art,” he said.    Others are less doomsday-ish.    “ The phonograph, synthesizer, cassette tape, computer, and internet didn’t manage to kill the music industry as many feared, so there is no reason to start clutching our pearls now,”  Austin Milne, a lecturer at the London College of Contemporary Music (LCCM), tells TNW.    LCCM is one of many music schools that have integrated AI into their teaching approach. However, Milne stresses that AI in music isn’t a monolith.   “There are some types which take the authorship and human touch out of the equation, and there are others that merely speed up processes musicians already undertake manually,” he says.    It’s an important distinction — like any powerful tool, it’s  how  AI is wielded that makes all the difference.    Whether AI popstars will usurp their human counterparts or not, I’m more excited about the potential of the technology to up my drumming game. So for now, thank you, machines, for allowing me to relive my musical fantasies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

Investors are hunting promising ESG businesses, governments are pushing ambitious legislation, and companies are getting on board to adopt new solutions. Sustainability funding is projected to reach unprecedented levels, with BCG Henderson Institute  estimating  accumulated global investment to achieve net zero to hit $75 trillion by 2050.    And yet, behind the curtain, the picture isn’t quite as rosy. According to  Statista , VC investment in sustainability and climate tech has been steadily declining since 2021. While AI startups often manage to secure funding rounds within mere weeks, sustainability-focused companies can spend years in fundraising limbo.  As a partner at VC consulting agency  Waveup , I’ve seen dozens of exceptional startups forced to bootstrap despite having validated technology and clear market potential — from sustainable agriculture solutions to carbon capture technologies.   Something just doesn’t add up in venture capital. Why aren’t investors backing the innovations needed to create a more sustainable future? The core issue lies in how they evaluate investment opportunities.   The great expectations mismatch   When looking at sustainability tech companies, most VCs expect rapid adoption, hockey-stick growth, and massive total addressable markets (TAMs) (understandably so, as otherwise, the VC formula might simply not work). They apply the same metrics and expectations used for SaaS and AI startups, and while some sustainability companies might fit this mould, many simply are too early in market adoption to demonstrate these characteristics.

Consider one of the clients we worked with developing revolutionary ocean-cleaning technology. The team managed to build a product with a clear and proven ability to drastically lower ocean pollution by reducing the amount of microplastics that enter the water. Despite recognition from the UN and an excellent client roster, the company has struggled with financing for years. For VCs, an absence of rapid growth overshadowed patented tech, past environmental impact, and excellent business economics. While recognising impressive results, most investors couldn’t get comfortable with the adoption timeline and speed of growth as, for many corporate clients, sustainability investments remain a “nice-to-have” category rather than a “must-have.”    It doesn’t help that many sustainability solutions require buy-in from multiple stakeholders within organisations, leading to longer and more unpredictable sales cycles. Worse, many companies also need significant upfront investment in physical assets or infrastructure, unlike purely software-based  startups . The result? Gloomy statistics: while traditional tech companies typically take three years from Series A to Series B, sustainability technologies need an average of seven-plus years to achieve scale.    The bottom line: impact investments aren’t yet firmly matching traditional VC returns. While there’s been a concerted push since 2015 to argue that impact returns are approaching venture returns, the data often tells a different story – and this performance gap creates a fundamental tension with the VC model. Venture funds operate under strict constraints: they have fiduciary duties to their limited partners, closed-end fund structures, and defined timelines for delivering returns. A fund’s ability to raise Fund II or III depends entirely on the performance of its previous investments. In this context, backing “good investments” that haven’t proven viable enough becomes paradoxically risky — even for an industry built on taking risks.    Rethinking the climate tech model   Financing the next generation of  climate tech  might require new solutions from everyone. The question is, are investors truly willing to find new models?   With many VCs (without calling out names), we’re seeing a troubling trend: rather than looking for new ways to adapt investment frameworks and  funding  mechanisms or dedicating more time to sourcing high-potential nascent climate tech startups, they hire consultants to reposition their existing portfolio companies as “ESG-friendly.” Essentially, this involves finding an ESG angle in otherwise traditional software companies to report to LPs strides made in financing sustainable tech solutions. Needless to say, this approach does little to drive meaningful environmental and social change.   What’s the alternative? We have a few ideas.   1. Rethink traditional funding mechanisms   VC investors need to work with other ecosystem players to offset financing risks while balancing risks and returns. Today, leading impact investors are working to combine traditional VC money with impact-first capital and structuring investments with different return tranches for various investors. Some use catalytic capital to de-risk early-stage investments or create revenue-based financing options for steady-growth sustainability companies. Others develop outcome-based funding models tied to impact metrics.     For companies struggling with VCs altogether, evergreen funds   that don’t have fixed lifecycles and allow for extended holding periods can better match sustainability tech’s development timelines. Corporate venture capital and large corporations facing pressures to transition to net zero can also become viable backers by providing both capital and pilot opportunities for sustainability startups.   2. Provide actionable help to accelerate the road to scaling   Monthly advice in board meetings will be valuable, but the true contribution lies in hands-on help driving adoption. The best impact investors put their time where their money is by partnering with corporate venture arms to secure pilot opportunities and market validation for their portfolio companies, collaborating with government agencies on grants and subsidies, and working with industry consortiums to accelerate adoption.   3. Adjust metrics and expectations   Investors need to consider new frameworks for evaluating sustainability investments. Traditional SaaS metrics could be replaced with impact-adjusted indicators that consider both financial and sustainability outcomes or allow for longer return lifecycles that align with the sector’s development timeline and adoption curves.   Important to note: this isn’t about lowering standards; it’s about adapting them to match the unique characteristics of sustainability technologies.    For VCs, the question shouldn’t be whether to invest in sustainability  tech  but how to adapt their approach to these critical innovations. Without this shift in perspective, we risk missing out on the next wave of transformative technologies that could help address our most pressing environmental and social challenges. After all, the biggest risk might not be backing sustainability tech too early — but too late.     Tech investing is  a key theme  of this summer’s  TNW Conference .

However, limited access to VC funding is forcing these early-stage companies to seek capital from outside the continent, according to a new report released at the Munich Security Conference today.   Venture financing in Europe averaged just 0.2% of GDP between 2013 and 2023, a fraction of the US average of 0.7%. While the continent is great at creating clean tech companies, it’s not so good at  funding  them.    The authors of  The Importance of Climate Tech for European Resilience  report — the World Fund, Kaya Partners, and Worthwhile Capital Partners — fear this trend isn’t just bad for business, but also leaves Europe exposed to geopolitical and economic shocks. Dependency on foreign powers for everything from solar panels to EVs is eroding Europe’s resilience, they said.    They warn that Europe has lost the early advantage in climate tech R&D that it established during the 2010s. Germany provides a good example. Despite being a frontrunner in solar and wind capacity in the early 2000s, the country saw its progress stall after 2012 due to tariff and subsidy policies. As a result, annual installed renewable capacity peaked at 9.7GW in 2012 and remained below that level until 2022.

They view defence as a unifying thread across these sectors.    The paper’s key recommendations include upgrading the energy grid, boosting long-term energy storage, and backing frontier tech like AI, fusion, and quantum computing. It also calls for an increase in EU defence spending to at least 3% of GDP.     Additionally, the report reiterates Mario Draghi’s call for €800bn in annual spending via public-private partnerships, regulatory streamlining, and expanded roles for institutions like the European Investment Bank.     Combined, these actions could provide a clear and solid basis for policies that actively strengthen resilience by 2029, the report argues.    The paper comes as world leaders gather at tense times in global politics, which are strengthening the case for European independence in venture financing.      “Disruption is upon us,”  said  Bo Lidegaard, a partner at Kaya Partners and co-author of the white paper. “ Europe must embrace it and reignite the creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship so deeply rooted with us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Siôn Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Siôn is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

The thought of mine brings a tear to my eye. It was a beautiful blue Nokia 3310 — and it was borderline indestructible. Best of all, the handset had the greatest mobile feature of all time: Snake.   It also offered calls and SMS, but I had little use for those extravagances. I had a pay-as-you-go contract, and money was tight back then. I also had a home phone — and Mum footed the bills. As for SMS, what was the point of that when you had the joys of    MSN Messenger  available for free?   Mobile calls and texts were strictly reserved for emergencies — like getting attacked in the street. Unfortunately, when that moment came, the assailants also stole my beloved Nokia 3310.   Those were the days. They were also the days when Europe led the world in mobile telecoms.  Finland’s Nokia was the world’s largest handset manufacturer, with Sweden’s Ericsson holding down third place. US rival Motorola sandwiched the two Scandinavian competitors.

Europe lost its lead due to slow adoption of  smartphones , weak software ecosystems, and fierce competition. American and Asian manufacturers now dominate the industry.   But Europe’s old mobile guard isn’t finished yet. The continent’s phone makers are still finding new routes into the market.   One of them stems from the resurgence of dumbphones. A reminder of  simpler times , the basic bricks offer a digital detox and an escape from relentless data harvesting.   A range of new versions have recently been launched. Older ones are also enjoying comebacks — including the legendary 3310.   Hackaday  recently spotlighted a technique that revitalises the classic handset: installing a USB-C socket.   The mod is the brainchild of Andrea Salvadori, a developer based in Italy. Salvadori adds the USB-C port by integrating a small adapter into the phone. He’s selling the parts online  for €25 .   My beloved 3310 would have cherished the upgrade, but the old device is sadly no longer with me. Thankfully, a host of modern dumbphones are now available.   Europe’s dumbphone rally   Many of the new dumbphones are made in Europe. One that’s caught our eye is the plastic-and-fantastic Barbie Phone. Built by Finland’s HMD Global in partnership with Mattel, the handset launched last year.   HMD bills the handset as a tool to “take a vacation from your smartphone.” It features a few basic apps and one extremely intriguing game: Malibu Snake. Digital wellbeing tips and “Barbie Meditation” are also available on the flip phone.   TNW contributor Siôn Geschwindt was  dazzled by  the device. Well, his four-year-old daughter was. “I love that pink one,” she said. “Wow stickers. I want it!”    Adults have also been impressed, but the lurid pink and Barbie branding aren’t for everyone. Fortunately, there are numerous other dumbphones on the market.   An impressive number of them are built by European companies.

Britain’s BAE Systems leapt by 9% on Monday, while Germany’s Rheinmetall jumped by 14%. Stocks in Sweden’s Saab, Italy’s Leonardo, and France’s Thales also boomed. By the day’s end, the Stoxx Europe aerospace and defence index had hit an all-time peak.   Military tech firms have also been surging. Kate Leaman, chief market analyst  at online broker  AvaTrade , said these companies have “huge potential” for growth — particularly those with AI-driven solutions.   “We’re already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,” Leaman told TNW. “This suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.”   Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       European defence tech  startups  have also grabbed investors’ attention. In 2024, they attracted  a record $5bn  in VC funding — a 24% increase over the previous year.   The momentum has raised expectations of future public listings.   “Many defence tech startups haven’t gone public yet, but with the market heating up and investor interest growing, there’s a strong possibility we’ll see more IPOs in the near future,” Leaman said.   “That could open the door to fresh investment opportunities and raise the profile of these emerging companies.”   The push for defence tech   The spending spree comes amid mounting concerns about Europe’s military sovereignty.   Leaders across the continent have been shaken by the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions with the Trump administration.   Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has called for the creation of an “army of Europe”. His French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, has urged his allies to “wake up” and spend more on defence. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to trigger an  emergency clause  exempting military expenditures from the fiscal restraints on EU countries.   A growing share of their budgets is going to military tech — and startups are beginning to cash in.   According to a new report  from McKinsey , investment in European defence tech startups increased by over 500% between 2021 and 2024 compared to the previous three years.   The report added, however, that the sector remains about five years behind the US’s in terms of maturity.   A major factor in this gap is the struggle to secure late-stage funding —  a  common problem  for European startups across industries.   Nonetheless, the rise of defence tech is set to continue.   “Military spending is rapidly moving away from traditional hardware toward software,  drones , and robotic solutions,” Leaman said. “As a result, defence tech companies specialising in these areas may enjoy increasing demand for their products and services.”     Defence tech is a key theme at this year’s Assembly, the invite-only policy track of  TNW Conference .

The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) today unveiled the 10 teams selected for the programme. Their mission: usher in a new era of dexterity that will transform robotics and human productivity.   Members of the group span startups, university labs, public research organisations, and large companies. Collectively, they will receive £52mn to advance the physical dexterity of robots.   The funds aim to bridge the software-hardware gap in robotics, which has widened during the AI boom.   TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.                           Check It Out                       Robot bodies now lag behind advances in computation. Their failure to match the flexibility, speed, and precision of humans has severely restricted their use.   Algorithms, meanwhile, are rapidly reaching new levels of intelligence. ARIA wants the hardware to catch up.   The agency argues that there’s a pressing need for progress. The proportion of the global population aged over 65 is set to triple by 2100. At the same time, labour shortages for physically demanding jobs are increasing. Robots could provide essential support.   The robotics teams   Members of the programme have proposed diverse solutions to the challenge.   Arthur Robotics, a startup based in London, wants to commercialise an mechnical hand inspired by biology. Focused on manufacturing, the motorised limb blends soft, deformable contact surfaces with rich tactile sensing and  reinforcement learning .   A team led by Lorenzo Jamone, an associate professor in robotics and AI at University College London, will develop electronic skin. Based on magnetic technology, the skin aims to measure 3D contact forces at multiple points. It can also bend and stretch.   Startups from outside the UK are also contributing. Denmark’s Pliantics will create soft linear actuators, which will serve as “artificial muscles” that enhance a robot’s physical interactions. Another set of artificial muscles will be built by Artimus, a US company, alongside researchers from the University of Bristol.   Nicholas Kellaris, the co-founder and Chief Research Officer of Artimus, praised the project’s emphasis on cooperation.   “This programme is unique in how it encourages and actively facilitates collaboration amongst creators at all levels of development, from fundamental hardware to the simulation, integration, and validation of full solutions,” he said. “We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to [join] this multi-level and cross-disciplinary approach.”   The ARIA model   Established in 2023, ARIA funds “high-risk, high-reward” research. The strategy has drawn comparisons to DARPA, a US Department of Defence agency that develops emerging technologies.   The Pentagon unit has been involved in a variety of transformative innovations, from the internet and GPS to stealth technology and autonomous vehicles.   At ARIA, a diverse array of projects is already underway. One unveiled last year plans to provide  “quantitative safety guarantees” for AI with  digital gatekeepers . Another aims to create  early warning systems  for climate tipping points. A third looks to nature to train AI at  0.1%  of the cost.

Long overshadowed by Silicon Valley and now being chased down by China ,  the continent is urgently looking for boosts. Increasingly, the search is leading to ecosystems.    The ecosystem model creates networks of individuals, organisations, and resources. Their shared expertise and resources can produce a multiplier effect, driving innovation and accelerating growth.   A core component of European ecosystems is the EU. While its tech strategy often faces criticism, the bloc has also played a key role in driving startup success.   Just ask Nicolas Benady, the CEO of Swan, a thriving banking-as-a-service (BaaS) fintech based in France.   Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla Sjöholm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       “Our company wouldn’t exist without the European Union,” he says.   Benady points to the impact of the Payment Service Directive, an EU law that established standardised rules for electronic payments. The legislation sparked the success of many global fintech leaders, from Revolut to Adyen. They finally had a chance to compete with banks in payments.   Swan has reaped the benefits. Last month, the startup announced it had raised €42mn — the second part of a Series B round that brought Swan’s total funding to an estimated €100mn.    “Without this directive, I don’t think we’d have so many fintechs today in Europe,” Benady says.   Fintechs are far from the only beneficiaries of the EU ecosystem — but the network still needs work.    At TNW’s  Nurturing Scaleup Success  webinar on Tuesday, Benady joined a panel of European tech experts to explain the power and peril of ecosystems. Their message was clear: no startup scales alone. Their success depends on a thriving ecosystem of partners.   4 pillars of a thriving ecosystem   Jason Lynch, CEO of quantum computing startup Equal1, has firsthand experience of the power of ecosystems. His company has partnered with  Arm  on computing breakthroughs, collaborated with Nvidia to blend hardware with software, and teamed up with the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) on product development.    Equal1 also recently secured investment from TNO. To strengthen the alliance, the startup has set up shop in another component of the Dutch ecosystem: the House of Quantum in Delft, a national campus for quantum  startups .   Lynch has high hopes for the relocation. “Being in a centre of excellence… is a critical piece of an ecosystem,” he says.    At the TNW webinar — now  available to watch  on-demand — Lynch broke down four crucial benefits of an ecosystem.   1. Talent   As Silicon Valley’s  network effects  continuously prove, startups benefit immensely from proximity to talent. The House of Quantum provides another promising example. With a steady stream of experts flowing through the site, the centre is giving Equal1 a fresh talent pipeline.   2. Infrastructure   Computation costs for startups can be astronomical. With access to shared infrastructure, startups can achieve dramatic savings.    3. Partnerships   Tech firms often rely on complex supply chains. Ecosystems offer a route to bring each component together. “What a centre of excellence like Delft offers is an ability to work very closely with companies that are just across the corridor,” says Lynch.    4. Customers   End users are drawn to areas with substantial expertise and companies. They help startups to validate and commercialise their products more quickly. “A hub like this really attracts in those end users,” says Lynch.    Yet Lynch also has concerns about EU ecosystems. Chief among them is a failure to commercialise ideas.   “It’s well-recognised that European research is leading the world. People would probably say that bringing that research to market is where Europe has more of a challenge. For me, that’s about speed, getting out of the way of startups, and trying to lower the barriers as much as possible.”   The money streams   EU policymakers are often slated for providing insufficient support to startups. There are growing signs, however, that their attitudes are changing.   Clotilde Hocquard, Public Affairs Lead at France Digitale, a European organisation that connects startups and  investors , points to several positive developments.   One is an expansion of funding streams, such as  a new EU initiative  to mobilise €200bn for AI investments.  Another is France’s  Tibi Initiative , which brings institutional investors together with accredited VC firms to encourage tech investing. “It should be replicated at the European level,”  Hocquard says.   Big ideas like this have been hard to bring to life, but they’re now attracting growing support. Hocquard noticed the momentum shift after last year’s publication of  the Draghi Report , which revealed alarming problems for European innovation.    “Policymakers are starting to realise that they need to do something to make sure startups can thrive in  Europe ,” she says.    Despite the positive signs, Hocquard wants faster progress. She points to another example set in the US.   “We have to make sure to mobilise pension funds and insurers, like in the United States. And we have to make sure the money is targeted towards VC funds and to finance innovation.”    But funding isn’t the only challenge for EU ecosystems.   The double-edged sword of regulation   Swan may only exist thanks to EU rules, but the bloc’s regulation is a double-edged sword.   One big problem is the diversity of laws. Despite the single market, the EU’s legislation is fragmented. “We don’t have anything single,” says Hocquard. “We have 27 member states doing what they want with their rules.”   This smorgasbord of laws raises barriers to scaling across borders. If the ecosystem could harmonise the rules, startups would face smoother paths to expansion.     Hocquard points to company law as a powerful and straightforward initial target. She also urges member states to stop twisting EU rules in different directions.   “If there’s a European law, it should be applied in a uniform way across the continent,” she says.   Ecosystems for scale   The urge to scale can lead to premature decisions. Benady advises early-stage founders to first focus on the product-market fit.   “Once you start to see commercial traction, then you have to scale your company — and this is a totally different game,” he says.   At that point, ecosystems become a key player. For Swan, they provided a vital boost to the company’s progress.    At first, however, Benady underestimated the value of two essential supporting structures.   “Even though my investors warned me, I paid attention a little bit too late to HR and finance,” he admits. “When you scale, you can’t mess with HR and finance.”   Benady compares their impact to musicians in a band.   “Finance and HR are the drum and the bass. That’s not what you hear; you hear the singer, you hear the guitar — but if you don’t have a perfect drum and bass, you won’t scale your company. So pay attention to finance and HR.”   To make sweet startup music, ecosystems need an orchestra of instruments. They require one section for talent, a second for infrastructure, another for partnerships, and a fourth for customers.   They also need the public and governments to hum along.  “The goal now is convincing citizens that investing in innovation is actually investing in the future of Europe,”  Hocquard says.  “Once we have the citizens with us, we need the policymakers to make all the legal changes.”   With that support,  Europe’s band of startups could be heading for the world stage.

Earthwave co-founder Livia Jakob said the project was invaluable to our understanding of glacier ice loss.    “We developed an algorithm to combine all the different datasets into one common estimate of glacier mass balance, giving us a new and improved picture of glacier behaviour in the past two decades,” Jakob told TNW via email.

View the Speakers                       Across the world, glaciers have lost an average of 273 billion tonnes of ice per year since 2000, according to the research, which was published in  Nature  today. That’s equivalent to the entire global population’s drinking water consumption for 30 years.   And the situation is snowballing. The rate of ice loss increased from 231 billion tonnes per year (2000–2011) to 314 billion tonnes per year (2012–2023) and doesn’t show any signs of slowing down.    The Alps worst hit   Temperatures in Europe’s highest mountain range are  rising twice as fast  as the global average.  Swiss glaciers  lost 6% of their total volume in 2022 alone, following intense summer heatwaves.    Dust from the Sahara could also be to blame for the rapid decline of central Europe’s glaciers. Particles in the air come from the Sahara desert and settle on glacier surfaces, darkening the ice. This causes them to absorb more solar radiation and melt faster.   But ultimately, human-induced climate change is the greatest culprit. If greenhouse gas emissions keep increasing, scientists  predict  the Alps could lose over 90% of their glacier mass by 2100.   Glacial retreat spells trouble for millions who rely on glacial melt for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower — while coastal communities brace for the rising tides. Over the study period, glaciers contributed 18mm to global sea-level rise.   The research was conducted as part of the Glacier Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise, or Glambie for short. The project  is a major research initiative coordinated by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) hosted at the University of Zurich, in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh and Earthwave.    Jakob co-founded Earthwave in 2018. The startup uses satellite remote sensing to monitor the effects of climate change or help other scientists unlock valuable insights from satellite data.    Eyes over glaciers   While many have  experienced  glacial decline first-hand, tracking it planet-wide is a bit more challenging. That’s where satellites can help.     Numerous satellites monitor Earth’s ice thickness from orbit. They use optical, radar, laser, and gravimetry instruments to provide data on glacier loss, sea ice changes, and rising sea levels.     The Glambie study used this information to compile one of the most comprehensive overviews of glacier retreat ever conducted.     The study included data from satellites including the USA’s Terra/ASTER and ICESat-2, the US–German GRACE, the German TanDEM-X, and the European Space Agency’s CryoSat.     As global temperatures continue to rise, studies like these deepen our understanding of how glacial melt impacts freshwater supplies, ecosystems, and sea-level rise — and what must be done to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

However, while these widgets promise fast and inexpensive compliance, they often fail to address the real issues of accessibility. In fact, they can even make websites  harder  for people with disabilities to navigate.    Here’s why relying on widgets is a short-sighted solution and what web  developers  should focus on instead to create truly accessible digital spaces.   What does the European Accessibility Act mean for developers?   The EAA, enacted in 2019, requires major e-commerce sites and private businesses to comply with a range of accessibility standards by June 28, 2025 (the deadline for public sector institutions has already passed). The rules apply to any company  that conducts business in the EU, except for microenterprises with fewer than  10 employees or under €2mn in annual turnover.

These regulations are designed to make websites more accessible to users with disabilities, covering aspects such as text alternatives for images, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. While the EAA primarily impacts large enterprises, it has also raised general awareness of accessibility, encouraging smaller businesses to review the accessibility of their sites.    As the deadline nears, the pressure to comply with the EAA has led some companies to pursue quick solutions. Accessibility widgets appear to offer an easy way to check the boxes.    Unfortunately, these tools often lead companies down the wrong path, creating a false sense of security and missing the opportunity to fix the underlying accessibility issues of their sites.   Why widgets are seen as a suitable solution   This is not to say that accessibility widgets are bad by default. Their appeal is easy to understand. They are low-cost, fast to implement, and, in many cases, do address common accessibility needs, such as the options to adjust font sizes and contrast settings.   As a result, these tools can often be enough for websites that feature relatively few elements, don’t handle high traffic volumes, or don’t require visitors to perform important actions — entering your bank account information, for example. For such websites, widgets can provide a layer of accessibility without requiring significant overhauls to existing design and  code .   For some businesses, especially those with limited resources, the promise of a widget is hard to resist. Adding a widget to your site will be considerably less expensive than ongoing testing, fixing, and maintenance processes. However, the reliance on widgets can not only delay fixing underlying issues with the site but can even lead to additional accessibility issues caused by the widgets themselves.   Widgets can cause more issues than they solve   A significant issue with widgets is that they tend to operate as overlays – they function as layers on top of the original website content rather than making structural improvements to the code. This layering can interfere with existing site functionality, causing problems with navigation, interactive features, or screen readers, which many users with disabilities rely on.    For example, my team at TestDevLab looked at the major fashion retailer Zara, which uses accessibility widgets on its website. We identified several issues caused by these tools. To name a few:     Site visitors who only use their keyboard for navigation cannot move to all elements after tapping the “Login” button because the focus jumps to the accessibility widget shortcut links.    If you select the dark, high-contrast option in the accessibility widget, the hamburger menu button and page logo are no longer visible.    A number of issues were detected with text adjustment and visibility when increasing the font size through the widget.      Because widgets typically only address surface-level issues, they fail to engage with underlying accessibility requirements like keyboard navigation and properly labelled images. Instead of solving these deeper problems, widgets often become long-term crutches that prevent real progress, allowing companies to overlook the foundational changes needed for meaningful accessibility.   Whether a widget works is often determined by how the original site has been built and structured. If there are issues in the site’s HTML code, layering a widget on top of that may not make a difference in terms of accessibility or, even worse, break other elements that make the site more challenging to navigate than it is without the widget. Other factors affecting widget performance include each site visitor’s browser and operating system. While the widget may work for some, it may fail for others.    Building accessibility from the ground up   True web accessibility requires investing in long-term, site-wide improvements rather than superficial fixes. Developers should consider accessibility a core part of the design and development process, not an afterthought. This means building accessibility into every stage of a website’s lifecycle, from design to testing.    Elements like keyboard navigation, text alternatives, logical heading structures, and responsive design should be considered from the start, making the website accessible at its foundation rather than through add-ons.    Testing is essential in this process. Accessibility is a continuous effort — it requires periodic audits and adjustments to ensure ongoing compliance as technology and accessibility standards evolve.

Engineering emerged as the country’s weakest STEM sector, ranking 21st globally.   The findings suggest there are grounds for optimism about the Dutch tech sector, despite recent heavy criticism. A  recent report  discovered a “worrying” decline in startups from the country, while founders have warned that  burdensome regulation  and  insufficient government support  are stunting the sector’s progress.   The report also illustrates the outsized role played by Europe’s smaller countries in nurturing science and technology.    Timo Lehne, the chief executive of SThree, said the rankings also stand as a clear warning sign for the G7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.   “Once the global epicentre for innovation, these countries are now facing stiff competition from emerging tech hubs,” he said. “Without a renewed focus on cultivating groundbreaking companies and embracing future-facing industries, their leadership in the tech race is no longer guaranteed.”   The future of Dutch tech will be a hot topic at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

A week before that, Donald Trump promoted Tesla on the White House front lawn, after rallying people to buy the company’s cars and stock.    The Trump administration’s endorsements of Musk’s companies are attracting growing scrutiny. Critics argue that they’re  breaking laws  and  threatening democracy . For the world’s richest man, the relationship is also causing business problems.   One involves Italy’s plans for Starlink. The country has halted talks for a proposed  €1.5bn contract  with the service, defence minister  Guido Crosetto  said in an  interview  Saturday.     “Everything has come to a standstill, partly because the topic has shifted from Starlink to statements by and about the person [Musk],” said the minister.     Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI, Monzo & Datasnipper Check out the NEW speakers for TNW Conference 2025 on June 19 & 20.                           View the Speakers                       It’s the latest development in a hot debate among Italian politicians over encrypted satellite communication services for officials in high-risk areas. Lawmakers are divided between choosing Starlink or a rival provider, such as French firm  Eutelsat .    Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government  has considered using Starlink for a while now. However, opposition parties have warned against relying on Musk’s firm  — a concern heightened by reports last month that the US may cut Ukraine off from Starlink if a minerals deal is not reached.    Musk refuted those claims. Nonetheless,   his control   over Ukraine’s connectivity has caused growing alarm. It forms  part of a broader discussion in Italy and Europe about reducing reliance on non-European tech for critical infrastructure.    Politics meets business for Musk   Question marks over Starlink mark one of a succession of setbacks for Musk, whose  role in the Trump administration and open support of far-right politicians has sparked a global backlash, with Tesla bearing the brunt.     European sales of Teslas plummeted 58% in the first two months of this year. Analysts have attributed the nosedive in part to Musk’s association with the White House and his embrace of MAGA politics.    “There is no doubt that ‘the Musk factor’ has influenced Tesla’s sales in the same way as his reputation impacted Twitter when he bought it and rebranded it as X,” Andrew Fellows, an automotive industry expert at Star, a global tech consultancy,  previously told TNW .   Tesla stock has fallen 40% since January. But people aren’t just voting with their wallets — there have also been widespread protests against the EV brand.    Tesla’s dealerships have been  vandalised . Cars have been burnt and charging stations petrol-bombed. In one of the more dramatic expressions of outrage, political campaigners beamed an image of Musk  making a Nazi-like salute   alongside the word “Heil” onto Tesla’s gigafactory in Berlin.
