 Scientists at the University of Potsdam have engineered so-called “moonglass” solar cells made by melting artificial moon dust or “regolith” and then combining it with a layer of perovskite crystal to create a working solar panel.  
 The device could be lighter, cheaper, and more radiation-resistant than the panels already used in  space , said the researchers. Their results were published in the journal  Device  this week. 
 Today, solar panels power satellites, space stations, and Mars and lunar rovers. All these arrays are currently built on Earth and launched into space. But as humanity pushes for a permanent lunar presence, the need for solar power is set to skyrocket — and so will the cost of getting panels there. 
 TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.

                     Felix Lang, lead author of the paper, said that while the silicon-based solar cells used in space now are “amazing” — reaching efficiencies of 30% to 40% — they are very expensive. They are also heavy because they use glass or a thick foil as a cover. “It’s hard to justify lifting all these cells into space,” he said. 
 Harnessing the Moon’s own regolith could be a game-changer. By creating moonglass directly on the lunar surface and pairing it with a thin layer of perovskite crystals brought from Earth, the researchers found they could slash launch mass by 99%.

 Once the materials are collected, turning them into solar panels on the Moon would require “minimal equipment,” according to the researchers, because they can be made with raw regolith that doesn’t need to be pre-processed. The team says they have already achieved promising results by using a large curved mirror and sunlight to focus a beam hot enough to melt regolith into moonglass. 
 Since moonglass is made from raw regolith, it’s milky-white instead of transparent, limiting its light-harvesting potential. The best prototypes from the Potsdam team reached about 12% efficiency — roughly half that of conventional perovskite cells. But simulations suggest they could eventually match the efficiency of conventional perovskite cells.  
 Nicholas Bennett at the University of Technology Sydney told  New Scientist  that this is the first successful use of moonglass in a functioning solar cell. The real challenge now, he says, is producing large quantities of the stuff outside of the lab. 
 Moonglass panels are the latest in a string of high-tech bids to lay the foundations for a permanent human presence on the Moon. Other planned projects include using moon dust to  3D-print a lunar base , building  oxygen extraction systems  from regolith, and even building  space mirrors  that melt the Moon’s ice into drinking water.

 The classy quintet joins an exclusive group of Europe’s fastest-growing tech companies. Over the next two months, they will join six other regions — the Nordics, Southern Europe, France, the Baltic States, DACH, and the UK & Ireland — in a competition for the crown of hottest scaleup on the continent.  
 The contest will conclude on June 19-20, when the TECH5 champion will be announced on the main stage of  TNW Conference . But first, the contenders have to win their regional title. 
 The challengers from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were selected based on an analysis of their growth, impact, and future potential. Our evaluation led us to the following five finalists, listed in random order: 
 1. DataSnipper

                     DataSnipper  has emerged as a shining star of Dutch tech. Over 500,000 audit and finance professionals across more than 125 countries now use the scaleup’s AI-powered software, which automates repetitive finance and audit procedures.  
 The company was profitable early on, scaled rapidly, and recently hit a $1bn valuation. Under the leadership of CEO Vidya Peters — one of the  star speakers  at this year’s TNW Conference — DataSnipper has be,en ranked by Deloitte as the fastest-growing tech firm in the Netherlands for two years in a row. 
 After finding success in Europe, the company has expanded globally, opening new offices in New York, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Mexico City. “That’s been a huge component of DataSnipper’s growth,” Peters  told TNW  last month. “Another is investing in AI.” 
 2. Dexter Energy 
 Dexter Energy  plans to transform the renewable energy landscape. To achieve this grand ambition, the scaleup provides AI-driven forecasting and trading-as-a-service for the short-term trading cycle. By making renewables trading profitable, Dexter Energy wants to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more affordable energy future. 
 “With our products, we empower energy companies across Europe to unlock the full  potential of their wind, solar, and battery portfolios, maximising efficiency, profitability,  and sustainability,” the company told TNW. 
 These plans have progressed rapidly since Dexter Energy was founded in Amsterdam in 2017. Last year, the scaleup reduced emissions equivalent to those produced by 100,000 households — a figure that’s been doubling annually. 
 3. Gorilla 
 Representing Belgium,  Gorilla  is reinventing the operations of energy retailers. The company supplies clients with real-time data and analytics, which lead to faster pricing, smarter decisions, and full visibility from sales to hedging.  
 “Our ambition is to become the commercial brain of energy retail,” Gorilla told TNW. “The impact? A more agile industry that can actually keep up with climate, policy, and consumer change.” 
 Founded in 2018, the Antwerp-based scaleup has partnered with many of the world’s top energy providers, including Shell, ScottishPower, ENGIE, and Centrica Business Solutions. Investors have been impressed by the progress. Last year, Gorilla raised €23mn in a Series B round led by US VC firm Headline. 
 4. Eye Security 
 Top-tier cybersecurity is often inaccessible to SMEs. Enterprise-grade solutions can be prohibitively expensive and complex. As a result, countless companies are left vulnerable to cyber threats.  
 Eye Security  plans to change that. The Dutch scaleup combines a 24/7 managed security operations centre (SOC), integrated cyber insurance, and expert-led incident response to streamline safeguards for SMEs. 
 The company’s founders have deep experience with digital threats. Before launching Eye Security in 2020, all three of them were national security employees. They’re now focused on supporting the most vulnerable businesses. “Our approach simplifies protection — combining advanced threat detection with insurance in one seamless service,” the team told TNW. 
 5. Gain.pro 
 In the lucrative world of private market intelligence,  Gain.pro  aspires to set the global standard. The Amsterdam-based fintech has developed a platform that unearths powerful insights to guide investment decisions.  
 Inside the platform, human curation and generative AI combine to find, understand, and track companies that matter to each user. The benefits have attracted an illustrious list of clients — including all the MBB (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) and Big 4 (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC) advisory firms. 
 “Our platform brings together verified public information and proprietary insights, empowering users to focus on high-value work that truly sets them apart,” Gain.pro told TNW. “In doing so, we’re making the world of M&A more transparent, efficient, and fair.” 
 What’s next for the TECH5 scaleups? 
 All five of these scaleups would make worthy winners for Benelux, but only one can triumph. The victor will be announced soon. Stay tuned next week to meet the next region’s challengers for the TECH5 title.

 Spectrum blasted off at 12:30 PM CEST (11:30 BST) but lost control at about 25 seconds into the flight. A video from the launch shows the rocket wobble, pitch over, and then plummet back to the ground, where it collided with the ocean, causing a large explosion. The launchpad remains intact and no one was injured, Isar said.

 Despite a quick and abrupt end to Spectrum’s inaugural flight, Isar’s CEO and co-founder Daniel Metzler hailed the launch as a “great success.”

                     “We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight, and even got to validate our flight termination system,” Metzler said. “With this result, we feel confident to approach our second flight.” 
 Spectrum’s first flight carried no payload. Isar Aerospace said the aim of the launch was “to collect as much data and experience as possible.” 
 The 28-meter (91-foot) Spectrum is a two-stage launch vehicle designed to propel small and medium-sized satellites into orbit. 
 The company expects to produce as many as 40 rockets per year from its new factory, which is currently under construction outside its headquarters in Munich. Spectrum launch vehicles 2 and 3 are already in production, Isar said. 
 Spectru m’s in augural flight marks the first-ever ver tical orbital  rocket launch i n cont inental E urope  outside Russia.   
 V ir gin Orbit a ttempt ed an  orbital la un ch from the UK  in 2 0 2 3, but  the plan failed. E urope’s  other rockets, Aria n e  6 and  Vega C, launch from Europe’s main  space port in F rench Guiana,  South America . 
 Isar Aerospace  is the   first  private  space company to use Andøya Spaceport, which officially  opened  in 2023. The spaceport, loc ated close  to the Arctic Circle , offe rs easy access  to  polar and su n-sync hronous orbits  — i deal for Earth observation  and  spy satellites. 
 Isar Aerospace signed a deal in February with  the N orwegian Sp ace Ag ency  to lau nch its  Arctic Ocea n Surve illance   (AOS) prog ram satellites until 2028.  The com pany l ooks to la unch up  to 15 missions per year from  And øya, at a cost of aro und €1 0mn per flight. 
 Opening up orbital launches from Western Europe promises to simplify logistics for European satellite operators by eliminating the need to ship payloads overseas. Access to smaller, cheaper launch vehicles that can place a single satellite in orbit could also offer a more flexible, fast, and precise alternative to ride-sharing. 
 Then there are the geopolitical considerations. Launching from continental Europe would reduce reliance on foreign launch providers like SpaceX, enhancing sovereign access to space amid growing geopolitical tensions. 
 Metzler touched on  that point in a statement last week: “In today’s geopolitical climate, our first test flight is about much more than a rocket launch.” 
 Founded  in 2018  as a spin-off   f rom Techni cal University Munich, Isar Aerospace has secured €400mn to date, making it Europ e’s mo st  well- f unded  private  space company. 
 While Andøya is Europe’s first continental spaceport, others are underway, the most advanced being the  SaxaVord spaceport  in the Shetlan d Island s off Scotland. 
 Rocket Factory Augsburg, a rival to Isar,  was m eant to launch from the site last year.  Howeve r, the startup suffered a major setback after its  rocket exploded   during   a st atic-fire test , pushing back  its in augu ral f light to later this year.

 ESA initially designed the Mars rover alongside Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, as part of the ExoMars programme. The vehicle was set to launch in 2022, but when Russia invaded Ukraine, ESA severed ties with Moscow, putting the mission in jeopardy. Rosalind Franklin — named after  the British chemist whose work was crucial to understanding the structure of DNA—  was left without several key components, including a landing platform to safely touch down on the Martian surface.  
 But now, ESA and  Thales Alenia Space, the prime contractor for the ExoMars mission,  have issued Airbus a  £150mn contract to build a new lander at the company’s facility in Stevenage, UK. The British government will fund the lander via the UK Space Agency.   
 “Getting the Rosalind Franklin rover onto the surface of Mars is a huge international challenge and the culmination of more than 20 years’ work,” said Kata Escott, managing director at Airbus Defence and Space UK, which also designed and built the rover.     
 The ExoMars spacecraft is set to launch from the US in 2028. Arrival on Mars is expected by 2030.  The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! 
 If successful, it will be Europe’s first rover to be sent to Mars. The US space agency NASA already has two in operation— Perseverance and Opportunity — while China has one, called Zhurong.

 As the spacecraft approaches Mars, the lander — carrying the rover — will separate and begin its rapid descent into the atmosphere. A combination of a heat shield, parachutes, and braking rockets will slow down the lander  just before touchdown.  
 Once on the surface, the lander will deploy ramps, allowing the rover to drive off and begin its exploration.  Rosalind Franklin’s instruments will look for evidence of past and present Martian life. The rover includes a drill designed to probe as deep as two metres into the surface, acquiring samples shielded from radiation on the surface. It’s designed to operate for at least seven months.  
 Since its fallout with Russia, ESA has secured new agreements for various components of the ExoMars spacecraft, including a contract with NASA to supply adjustable braking engines for the landing platform and radioisotope heating units (RHUs). These RHUs use radioactive decay to generate heat, preventing the rover from freezing in the frigid Martian environment.

Today’s top tech talent wants something far more valuable: their health. That’s the view of Lucien Engelen, a renowned healthcare innovation expert, who believes workplace wellbeing is about to spark a seismic shift. This transition will not only transform employment perks, but also create a new tech market. 
 Engelen’s vision draws on deep experience. Across three decades in healthcare, his work has spanned acute care, ambulance services, and dispatch centres. As the founding director of the REshape Center of the Radboud University Medical Center, he spent eight years developing and implementing healthcare technologies, grabbing headlines for efforts to  integrate patients  in their own care and improve service provision  with social media . 
 Today, he focuses on running Transform.Health, which assists organisations such as Vodafone, Erasmus University Medical Center, Deloitte, and Sanofi in their healthcare strategies. He also delivers 100 keynotes a year across the globe about the subject.  
 These roles revealed a fundamental flaw in conventional treatment. “We’ve built a sick care system, not a healthcare system,” he says. 
 Engelen compares the problem to bad plumbing.   “We wait until water gushes out of the wall before fixing the leak, instead of turning off the tap.”  3 free tickets to TNW Conference? Get them now!

 For Engelen, the fix is obvious. We need to shift the focus from treating illnesses to preventing them. And employers have a crucial role to play. 
 At  TNW Conference  on June 19, Engelen will share his vision in full during a talk titled “CODE RED: Why the Future of Work is the Future of Health.” Ahead of the event, he shared a glimpse of what to expect. 
 Employers as catalysts for wellbeing 
 The business case for staff wellbeing is obvious: healthier employees deliver higher performance. Illness, stress, and long waits for medical care drain their productivity and availability. 
 “If it takes eight weeks to get a consultation, that’s eight weeks of lower productivity,” Engelen notes. “And if they leave due to poor health, replacing them can cost about €40,000 in rehiring and training someone to reach the same level.” 
 To stay ahead, forward-thinking employers are getting proactive. Instead of waiting for health problems to arise, they’re offering services that can prevent them.  
 Technology is rapidly expanding the possibilities. From digital wellbeing  apps  and fitness trackers to online therapy, these perks are becoming a competitive advantage in attracting elite workers.  
 As Engelen says, “We’re all fishing in the same bucket of talent.” 
 To attract that talent, he urges  employers to apply a broader concept of wellbeing. “It’s not only about your physical health. There’s also your mental health, and even your social health and financial health.” 
   Gradually, this holistic model is shaping modern  workplaces. 
 The next generation 
 For employers, mental health services have become a growing focus — and with good reason. Deloitte research found that UK organisations investing in mental health support see an average return of  five to one . 
 The benefits could be especially impactful for younger workers. A  recent study  by PwC found that almost four in 10 Gen Z employees in the UK have seriously considered leaving their jobs in the last year, with mental health “a major driver.”  
 Digital services offer promising solutions. Yet they also introduce new challenges. 
 “The same Gen Z that is willing to step down due to mental health concerns also thinks privacy is very important — for the right reasons,” Engelen says. “The challenge now for companies is offering solutions without sacrificing their privacy.” 
 Engelen sees employers addressing this by offering third-party services that staff can use confidentially, away from the prying eyes of bosses or colleagues. For instance, they’re providing anonymised access to online mental health services and fitness apps connected to gyms outside the company — with no  data  flowing back to the business. 
 This growing focus on employee wellbeing also has powerful potential for  tech  firms. Engelen envisions a new market emerging for them. 
 “We’ll see an increase in Big Tech closing big contracts with big corporates,” he says.  
 “We will also see Big Tech acquiring more startups in this sector than ever before, because they can not only get this technology scaled, but also access a market that is willing to pay for it. Now that employers see the real financial benefit of this, it is going to create a new revenue stream.” 
 For tech companies, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same is true for employers.  
 The future of wellbeing in the workplace 
 The benefits of healthy workplaces are well-established. Researchers have found that the ROI on employee wellness programs  can be  six to one.  
 “Employers are realising that investing in prevention is far cheaper than paying for treatment or replacing talent — and can also attract talent,” Engelen explains. 
 Accessibility to digital wellbeing is also set to increase. Integration layers are connecting more and more healthcare apps, creating new approaches to medical care. The EU, meanwhile, recently ratified the European Health Data Space regulation, which will enforce mandatory access to medical records on users’ smartphones. 
 As the technology progresses and enters the workplace, the ripple effects could improve lives and productivity, while alleviating pressure on overburdened health systems. 
 By embracing wellbeing tech, Engelen believes employers can accelerate a shift from reactive healthcare to proactive prevention. 
 “The technology is already there,” he says. “What’s changing is how we’re using it. Employers have realised that investing in health and wellbeing is not just good for their people — it’s good for business.”

 The Berlin-based World Fund warns that simply transitioning data centres to renewable power will not be enough to fully decarbonise AI compute.  
 “We need to rethink the way we go about computing, from the materials and chips we use to software we run,” Daria Saharova, founding partner at World Fund, said at the  Future  of Green Computing  event in Munich today.   
 At the event, World Fund joined Dealroom and Intel’s deeptech accelerator Ignite to unveil a new report that proposes a set of emerging technologies — from chips made in space to  processors that mimic the brain — to curb AI’s enormous appetite for energy and usher in a new era of greener computing.

                     Using data from Dealroom, the report maps out the green computing ecosystem. It identifies 65  startups  in this space, 54 of which are European, which have collectively raised $900mn. Over half of these companies were founded within the past five years, with 12 emerging in just the last 12 months.  
 A greener vision of AI 
 The report highlights three key technologies that hold the most potential to decarbonise AI.  
 The first is advanced semiconductor materials such as Gallium Nitride (GaN), Silicon Carbide (SiC), and graphene. These could significantly reduce AI’s energy consumption by improving efficiency and thermal performance in computing hardware.  
 One of the leading innovators in this space is Welsh startup  Space Forge . The company is leveraging the microgravity, vacuum, and extreme temperatures of space to produce semiconductors that it claims are three to five times purer than those made on Earth.  
 “We’ve pushed the efficiency of silicon chips to their limit,” said Joshua Western, CEO and cofounder at  Space Forge . 
 Another promising avenue lies in new computing paradigms, such as quantum, neuromorphic, and optical computing.  Quantum computers , for instance, promise to solve complex calculations much faster than classical machines, potentially reducing computational time and overall energy consumption.  
 “Classical computers are getting too big, too expensive, and use too much energy and water,” said  Inés De Vega ,  VP of innovation at  IQM , Europe’s best-funded quantum computing startup.  “Quantum computing can both find new solutions to  climate change  but also drastically reduce the overall energy consumption of computing itself.” 
 Another type of computing gaining traction is optical computing, which leverages photons — particles of light — instead of electrons. It could dramatically increase processing speed, as demonstrated by Germany’s Black Semiconductor. The company’s photonics processors could transmit signals 100 to 1,000 times faster than traditional electronic chips. 
 Anastasiia Nosova, a former chip engineer at German semiconductor giant  Infineon  and host of the  Anastasi In Tech podcast, argued that  photonic chips could be 100 times more energy efficient than regular silicon semiconductors. “They are one of the most important developments in computing right now,” she said at the Munich event..   
 While hardware fixes will be critical, there’s also work to be done in advanced software that makes AI’s energy use more efficient. One of the startups working on this is London-based Deep Render. The company uses  deep learning  to compress files while retaining quality beyond what was previously possible. This reduces the volume of data that needs to be transmitted or stored, and thus the amount of computing power required.  
 While these technologies hold potential, they’re still in the nascent stages of development. Meanwhile, the energy needed to train AI models is doubling every three to four months,  according to OpenAI .   
 “For these computing solutions to scale in Europe, we need a lot of venture capital but also government backing,” said Saharova. She believes that Europe needs to allocate about  €1 trillion to bring climate tech, including green computing, to the “level it needs to be.”

As the founder and CEO of Ukrainian scaleup MacPaw, Kosovan runs his business in a country under invasion. The company has even been hit by missile barrages. 
 As relentless Russian bombing and shelling pummel Ukraine, his team presses on with their work. In October, they released a new version of CleanMyMac, MacPaw’s flagship maintenance and optimisation product.  
 “It was completely developed during the war,” Kosovan tells TNW on a video call from his home in Kyiv. 
 The software earned  rave   reviews . But two months later, the horrors of war arrived at MacPaw’s doorstep. 
 On a cold December morning, another devastating Russian ballistic missile attack struck Kyiv. The explosion hit MacPaw’s headquarters, shattering the building’s facade, windows, and engineering equipment. According to the rescue services, one person was killed in the attack.  TNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched down Discover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.

 Kosovan was en route to an event when a message about the strike appeared on his phone. 
 “The only thing we could do is initiate our emergency procedures,” Kosovan says. “We had plans for this risk and they helped us to organise actions — because people were panicked. They didn’t know what to do.” 
 Safety measures were swiftly implemented, emergency checks conducted, and recovery steps taken. The next day, MacPaw gained access to the office building. Staff worked alongside emergency services to salvage equipment and prevent further damage.  
 The company’s office spans three floors of the building. The hardest hit of them is still not operational, but the others have reopened. Staff are already working in them again. 
 MacPaw’s wartime adaptations had given the business a head start on the recovery. Many team members were already working remotely. Processes had become highly automated. Staff were spread out geographically and shifts were scheduled to cover all critical roles during emergencies and military call-ups. 
 While the missile strike was traumatic, MacPaw had been prepared.

 As Russian troops amassed on the border with Ukraine in late 2021, MacPaw began disaster planning.  
 The company devised mitigation measures for various threats, from cyber attacks to Russian forces taking control of the office. An emergency team was formed from each product and service unit, with members based either outside Ukraine or in the country’s safer western regions. 
 Communications security was beefed up, with Signal adopted as a new messaging service. Office infrastructure was moved entirely to the cloud. Satellite internet was set up to cover the risk of internet loss. The company then waited for reports on Russia’s military moves. 
 On day one of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, MacPaw activated its risk mitigation plan. 
 “We had to refocus our priorities,” Kosovan says. “The first of them was, of course, the safety of our people, and then the continuity of our business.” 
 A code freeze regime was implemented for all products and infrastructure, with no changes permitted without prior approval from the emergency team. 
 Hardware management strategies also shifted. With supply chains disrupted, new laptops now had to be sourced from abroad. At times, system administrators had to drive to remote locations and personally deliver laptops to team members. 
 As wartime conditions became routine, the team adapted to their new reality. Nowadays, their biggest challenge is Russia’s relentless attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. 
 The strikes cause frequent and protracted power outages. In MacPaw’s home town of Kyiv, daily blackouts of eight hours have become commonplace, leading more team members to work from the office. To keep operations running, the company has installed extra power and internet access lines. A backup generator has also been acquired, alongside an uninterrupted internet access point via Starlink. 
 “Starlink helps a lot,” Kosovan says. “It is one of the saving factors for Ukraine.” 
 The new measures have kept MacPaw’s systems running throughout Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power grid. But the human impacts have been harder to resolve.

 Although no MacPaw staff were physically harmed in the missile attack, the psychological toll has been profound. 
 “The greatest challenge we and many other companies are facing here right now is not the destruction of the offices, but the exhaustion of these people,” says Kosovan. “Mentally, this is very hard to process. People are breaking sometimes, and it is very hard to predict and help them.” 
 For months, staff in Kyiv have endured air strikes day and night. “People cannot sleep normally because they always hear these explosions in the air…They don’t know whether the next night a drone will hit their house or not.” 
 The brutality of the December missile attack was a stark contrast to the previous day at MacPaw. Staff had been preparing holiday gifts for  Children of Heroes , an organisation that supports Ukrainian children who have lost parents in the war. 
 Through the  MacPaw Foundation , the company also provides Ukrainians with non-lethal aid, including protective gear, IT equipment, and medical supplies. Since 2022, the non-profit has distributed over $12mn in total support 
 Alongside the humanitarian projects, Kosovan is helping to sustain the country’s IT sector. He’s personally invested in almost 20 Ukrainian businesses, including Osavul, a Kyiv-based AI  startup  that analyses information threats. 
 Formed to counter Russian propaganda, Osavul now offers services to governments and businesses alike. “Our goal is to review the narratives, show which of them are dangerous, and then give you all the intelligence to understand what you can do,” Dmytro Bilash, the startup’s co-founder,  told TNW  last year. 
 In combat zones, Ukrainian tech also has a powerful impact. Innovations range from a growing fleet of domestic drones to Delta, a battlefield management system. Developed by the military, the  software  combines a variety of tools, from digital maps to secure communications.  
 Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Yelyzaveta Boiko describes the system as “Google for the military.” “Google helps to organise your workspace, DELTA helps to organise your war space,” she  said  last year. 
 Beyond the theatre of war, MacPaw has sought to preserve Ukraine’s tech heritage. The latest result is  Innovation in Isolation  — a book that chronicles the country’s IT history. 
 The past and future of Ukrainian tech

 Released in Europe and the US last month,  Innovation in Isolation  explores Ukrainian tech from the 1940s to today. 
 Through archival research, interviews with IT luminaries, and vivid photography, the book unravels the country’s digital evolution. The stories span from cybernetics pioneers to modern innovators such as Grammarly and  Reface .  
 All proceeds from the book will go to humanitarian relief efforts through the MacPaw Foundation. Yet the project is not solely a charitable endeavour.  
 “It’s also important to talk about the history, because we all see how Russia tries to change the past by rewriting the history and claiming a lot of things as their own,” says Kosovan. 
 “Many things that were considered to be built in Russia or USSR were actually created by Ukrainians and Ukraine. This partially explains why there are so many great tech companies from Ukraine. We have a very rich heritage.”  
 Even after missile strikes, that heritage continues to flourish. 
 “There are many companies that emerge in these hard times,” Kosovan says. “Hard times produce strong people. If companies can survive, despite the war and all its challenges, the company has a long-term future.”

 The UK-based lab has tightened its rules on releasing AI studies,  the  Financial Time s reported  this week.  Citing seven current and former DeepMind scientists, the newspaper said the company has introduced stricter vetting and additional bureaucracy, making it harder to publish research . The changes aim to protect the company’s edge in AI, the sources said. 
 Acquired by Google  in 2014 , DeepMind has long been a leader in computer science breakthroughs. In recent years, however, the lab has faced increasing competition from the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek.  Under growing pressure to stay ahead, the company is reportedly erecting new barriers around its innovations and reputation. 
 The new constraints have alarmed  Anita Schjøll Abildgaard , co-founder and CEO of  Iris.ai , a Norwegian startup developing an AI-powered  engine for science . She fears DeepMind’s restrictions will hinder technological advances.

                     “DeepMind’s decision marks the end of an era of openness and collaboration in AI research,” she said. 
 The impact on AI 
 On first impression, the changes at DeepMind may appear beneficial for other AI labs. The company’s pioneering  innovations  and enormous citation counts have overshadowed other researchers in the field, who could now receive a larger share of the spotlight. But Abildgaard warns the drawbacks will far outweigh the benefits. 
 “Researchers across industries will have less access to DeepMind’s undoubtedly impressive work,” she said. 
 She pointed to the example of DeepMind’s  AlphaFold , a system that predicts protein structure with remarkable accuracy. The software has been  hailed  as a solution to one of biology’s biggest mysteries, with potential to fuel countless advances, from discovering new drugs to tackling climate change. 
 “It’s hard to imagine projects of this importance being released so readily under this new diktat,” Abildgaard said. 
 The impacts, she warned, could be severe. In response, she urged AI companies to strengthen their commitment to openness. 
 “Europe, in particular, has one of the most fertile open-source research communities in the world,” she said. “As DeepMind looks inwards, smaller research communities can differentiate themselves from the American giants by embracing collaboration.”

Is this the future of car sharing?,"Vay's remote-driven cars could offer a superior form of car sharing, but in Europe the service is stuck in a traffic jam of red tape","April 3, 2025 - 3:58 pm","“Hello, I will be your driver for today,” says Bartek Szurgot, a software engineer at German startup Vay and my chauffeur for this ride. He disengages the handbrake, gently presses the accelerator and the new Kia Niro EV I’m sitting in slowly pulls out of the parking lot.    
 As we approach the first intersection, Bartek indicates, turns the steering wheel, makes his observations, and drives out onto a busy road near the centre of Berlin. So far, pretty standard  — except for one big difference. 
 Bartek isn’t in the car. He’s in an office a few blocks away, controlling the vehicle like a high-tech puppeteer. 
 
 Remote operators like  Bartek  command Vay’s cars  from a video game-style  station equipped with a driver’s seat, steering wheel, pedals, and three monitors providing visibility in front of the car and to its side.

                     Road traffic sounds, such as emergency vehicle sirens and other warning signals, are transmitted via microphones to the teledriver’s headphones. Operators could be sitting on the other side of the world.  
 Vay has developed a proprietary hardware and  software  system called “drive-by-wire” that communicates with the car’s key controls, including the steering wheel, brake, and gear shifter. Electrical signals transmitted from the remote operating station tell the system what to do, enabling the car to mirror the remote driver’s actions in real time.  
 Redundant mobile networks  transmit the data. In the event of a network failure or emergency, the vehicle automatically comes to a safe stop. 
 Vay’s remote drivers spend most of their time delivering vehicles to customers, who hail the cars on an app. After the car arrives, users take the wheel and drive themselves.

 Customers can use the car for a short trip, hours, days, or even longer. Once they’re done, they stop the car safely in the road, apply the handbrake, get out, and carry on with their day. Then, a remote operator takes over again and drives on to the next client.    
 As anyone familiar with autonomous vehicles will know, watching a car drive itself takes some getting used to. Knowing that my “driver” was blocks away, steering through screens and sensors, made every turn feel surreal. But once you get used to it, the ride is almost disappointingly normal — I suppose that’s the point.   
 Vay’s tech is impressive, no doubt, but in Europe, regulators may strangle its potential before it ever scales. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Vay is accelerating. 
 Vay already has  a 40-strong fleet of remote-controlled cars in Las Vegas. In Berlin and across Europe, though, progress has been slower, with no commercial service in place yet.  
 Due to regulatory red tape, Vay is limited to test drives only and is required to keep a safety driver onboard. It has previously received an exemption, though.  In 2023, it used one such regulatory hall pass to become  the first company  to operate a car on a European public road without a person inside.   
 However, the German government hands out such permits sparingly. That’s why I couldn’t take the wheel on our test drive. That was Graeme’s job, our safety driver for the trip. Nevertheless, it gave me a firm idea of what to expect.

 The future of car sharing? 
 When I first heard of Vay’s remote driving concept a couple of years back, I was skeptical. The company touted the benefits: less hassle, cheaper fares, better working conditions for workers. But it seemed like a business model at risk of fading into irrelevancy once self-driving cars went mainstream. 
 But with my mind fixated on the paradigms of ride-hailing on one hand and full autonomy on the other, I may have overlooked that Vay was doing something radically different. 
 “We’re creating a whole new category of mobility,” Thomas von der Ohe, Vay’s CEO  and co-founder, tells me from the company’s headquarters in Berlin. After spending years  in the Bay area building self-driving cars, he came back to Europe, founding Vay in 2018 alongside Fabrizio Scelsi and Bogdan Djukic.  
 Vay’s rides in Las Vegas cost about half as much as  Uber . Von der Ohe says they keep prices low by reducing driver labour costs. With ride-hailing services, it’s one driver, one car. But a single Vay driver can oversee up to 10 vehicles on any given day. When they drop one car at a customer, the drivers can “teleport” and gain control of another vehicle.  
 Vay could offer a taxi-style service where passengers ride in the back, but that would cut into profits and drive up prices. That’s why letting customers drive themselves makes business sense, says Von der Ohe.  
 Vay aims to make its biggest impact in car sharing and rentals, not ride-hailing. Von der Ohe says the company can match average car rental prices in Germany while helping rental firms cut costs by reducing the need for large parking facilities, especially at busy airports.  
 Vay also hopes to provide a better version of car sharing. Customers don’t need to pick up or park their cars — major hassles in dense European cities. Fleet owners can keep vehicles in use longer, and Von der Ohe believes the model could even reduce private car ownership in urban areas.  
 All this makes for a compelling value proposition. Vay has raised $150mn in funding so far, including  €34mn  ($37mn) from  the European Investment Bank.  
 But there are still many potholes in the road. Outside Las Vegas, Vay is still unproven — and regulatory red tape isn’t making things easier.  
 In Europe, governments have been slow to adopt rules for remotely driven cars. Currently, the vehicles are subject to much the same guidelines as autonomous vehicles — which are patchy at best.   
 “We have the tech, it works, it could be all over Berlin and Europe,” says Von der Ohe. “But politics get in the way, there’s no consensus. It’s just so weird.”  
 Vay has completed over 10,000 trips in Vegas and  plans to scale its fleet of remote-controlled Kia Niros to 100 this year.  The company  recently secured a new production facility in Sin City where it will retrofit the cars with its drive-by-wire system and a relatively inexpensive set of cameras. To fund the expansion, the company is also lining up another funding round, says Von der Ohe. 
 After my test drive, I called an Uber to take me to Berlin Brandenburg Airport. As it rolled up, I couldn’t help but wish it arrived empty — just waiting for me to jump in and take the wheel. Maybe one day. But for now, if I want that future, I’ll have to book a ticket to Vegas.

 The US slapped a 20% tariff on imports from the EU — twice the rate for the UK. Switzerland fared even worse, receiving a hefty 32% levy.  
 Several European tech firms,  investors , and analysts told TNW that the measures could disrupt supply chains, force pricing adjustments, and stem the flow of transatlantic VC capital — plunging European tech companies big and small into uncertainty. 
 “Trump’s trade tariffs will have a huge impact on the global tech landscape, forcing startups to reconsider their headquarters and assess alternative markets,” said Louis Fearn, principal and sustainability lead at InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover.

                     For companies with hardware-dependent models, the tariffs represent a major cost challenge. Miika Mäkitalo, CEO of Finnish firm HappyOrNot, which makes customer feedback terminals, noted that nearly half of the company’s business is across the pond. He said the tariffs might force the firm to consider “initiating assembly and production in the United States.” 
 Although the tariffs only apply to physical goods, service-based startups will also feel the impact.  
 Benjamin Avraham, founder and CEO of Swiss fintech Okoora, said there are many “secondary effects” that will harm the “smaller startup community” indirectly. These include changes in supply chains, barriers to VC investments, and increased volatility in exchange rates.   
 Software could also suffer from additional constraints. Amanda Brock, CEO at open-source lobby group OpenUK, said that while software has long been characterised as an intangible service, it “may be subject to other trade restrictions.”  
 The fallout has already begun. Trump’s tariffs have sent markets into disarray and risk compounding existing tensions in global trade. Stocks  have plunged  around the world and countries  have promised  retaliatory measures. “The newly announced blanket tariffs by President Trump create more uncertainty in the global tech industry,” said Martin Hartley, Group CCO of international tech consultancy Emagine. “These measures could make businesses in the EU avoid the US altogether to sidestep additional costs.” 
 For European startups, the tariffs may force a stark strategic choice. “Trump is playing with fire,” warned Matt Penneycard, partner at UK-based Ada Ventures. “Startups selling to US customers now face two options: anchor in Europe and embrace its stability, or find ways to maintain access to the States by setting up operations there.”  
 He added that this moment could be an opportunity for Europe. “As the US becomes a tougher place to operate, top talent may follow stability — this is Europe’s moment to build a new Silicon Valley.”
