    "body": "Future lunar bases could run on solar panels forged from molten moon dust, turning the Moonâs surface into an energy source,  thanks to a new research breakthrough.Â    Scientists at the University of Potsdam have engineered so-called âmoonglassâ solar cells made by melting artificial moon dust or âregolithâ and then combining it with a layer of perovskite crystal to create a working solar panel.Â    The device could be lighter, cheaper, and more radiation-resistant than the panels already used in  space , said the researchers. Their results were published in the journal  Device  this week.   Today, solar panels power satellites, space stations, and Mars and lunar rovers. All these arrays are currently built on Earth and launched into space. But as humanity pushes for a permanent lunar presence, the need for solar power is set to skyrocket â and so will the cost of getting panels there.

View the Speakers                       Felix Lang, lead author of the paper, said that while the silicon-based solar cells used in space now are âamazingâ â reaching efficiencies of 30% to 40% â they are very expensive. They are also heavy because they use glass or a thick foil as a cover. âItâs hard to justify lifting all these cells into space,â he said.   Harnessing the Moonâs own regolith could be a game-changer. By creating moonglass directly on the lunar surface and pairing it with a thin layer of perovskite crystals brought from Earth, the researchers found they could slash launch mass by 99%.

Credit: Sercan Ãzen   Once the materials are collected, turning them into solar panels on the Moon would require âminimal equipment,â according to the researchers, because they can be made with raw regolith that doesnât need to be pre-processed. The team saysÂ they have already achieved promising results by using a large curved mirror and sunlight to focus a beam hot enough to melt regolith into moonglass.   Since moonglass is made from raw regolith, itâs milky-white instead of transparent, limiting its light-harvesting potential. The best prototypes from the Potsdam team reached about 12% efficiency â roughly half that of conventional perovskite cells. But simulations suggest they could eventually match the efficiency of conventional perovskite cells.Â    Nicholas Bennett at the University of Technology Sydney told  New Scientist  that this is the first successful use of moonglass in a functioning solar cell. The real challenge now, he says, is producing large quantities of the stuff outside of the lab.   Moonglass panels are the latest in a string of high-tech bids to lay the foundations for a permanent human presence on the Moon. Other planned projects include using moon dust to  3D-print a lunar base , building  oxygen extraction systems  from regolith, and even building  space mirrors  that melt the Moonâs ice into drinking water.

    "body": "The European Space Agencyâs (ESA) Rosalind Franklin rover is back on course for a landmark trip to Mars, where it will probe the red planet for signs of extraterrestrial life.Â    ESA initially designed the Mars rover alongside Roscosmos, Russiaâs space agency, as part of the ExoMars programme. The vehicle was set to launch in 2022, but when Russia invaded Ukraine, ESA severed ties with Moscow, putting the mission in jeopardy. Rosalind Franklin â named after  the British chemist whose work was crucial to understanding the structure of DNAâ  was left without several key components, including a landing platform to safely touch down on the Martian surface.Â    But now, ESA and  Thales Alenia Space, the prime contractor for the ExoMars mission,  have issued Airbus a  Â£150mn contract to build a new lander at the companyâs facility in Stevenage, UK. The British government will fund the lander via the UK Space Agency.Â Â    âGetting the Rosalind Franklin rover onto the surface of Mars is a huge international challenge and the culmination of more than 20 yearsâ work,â said Kata Escott, managing director at Airbus Defence and Space UK, which also designed and built the rover.Â Â Â Â    3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

Arrival on Mars is expected by 2030.Â    If successful, it will be Europeâs first rover to be sent to Mars.

Credit: DSIT   As the spacecraft approaches Mars, the lander â carrying the rover â will separate and begin its rapid descent into the atmosphere. A combination of a heat shield, parachutes, and braking rockets will slow down the lander  just before touchdown.Â    Once on the surface, the lander will deploy ramps, allowing the rover to drive off and begin its exploration.  Rosalind Franklinâs instruments will look for evidence of past and present Martian life. The rover includes a drill designed to probe as deep as two metres into the surface, acquiring samples shielded from radiation on the surface. Itâs designed to operate for at least seven months.Â    Since its fallout with Russia, ESA has secured new agreements for various components of the ExoMars spacecraft, including a contract with NASA to supply adjustable braking engines for the landing platform and radioisotope heating units (RHUs). These RHUs use radioactive decay to generate heat, preventing the rover from freezing in the frigid Martian environment.

As the founder and CEO of Ukrainian scaleup MacPaw, Kosovan runs his business in a country under invasion. The company has even been hit by missile barrages.   As relentless Russian bombing and shelling pummel Ukraine, his team presses on with their work. In October, they released a new version of CleanMyMac, MacPawâs flagship maintenance and optimisation product.Â    âIt was completely developed during the war,â Kosovan tells TNW on a video call from his home in Kyiv.   The software earned  rave   reviews . But two months later, the horrors of war arrived at MacPawâs doorstep.   Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla SjÃ¶holm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                       On a cold December morning, another devastating Russian ballistic missile attack struck Kyiv. The explosion hit MacPawâs headquarters, shattering the buildingâs facade, windows, and engineering equipment. According to the rescue services, one person was killed in the attack.Â    Kosovan was en route to an event when a message about the strike appeared on his phone.   âThe only thing we could do is initiate our emergency procedures,â Kosovan says. âWe had plans for this risk and they helped us to organise actions â because people were panicked. They didnât know what to do.â   Safety measures were swiftly implemented, emergency checks conducted, and recovery steps taken. The next day, MacPaw gained access to the office building. Staff worked alongside emergency services to salvage equipment and prevent further damage.Â    The companyâs office spans three floors of the building. The hardest hit of them is still not operational, but the others have reopened. Staff are already working in them again.   MacPawâs wartime adaptations had given the business a head start on the recovery. Many team members were already working remotely. Processes had become highly automated. Staff were spread out geographically and shifts were scheduled to cover all critical roles during emergencies and military call-ups.   While the missile strike was traumatic, MacPaw had been prepared.   Preparing for war   Numerous buildings were damaged by the missile strike. Credit: MacPaw   As Russian troops amassed on the border with Ukraine in late 2021, MacPaw began disaster planning.Â    The company devised mitigation measures for various threats, from cyber attacks to Russian forces taking control of the office. An emergency team was formed from each product and service unit, with members based either outside Ukraine or in the countryâs safer western regions.   Communications security was beefed up, with Signal adopted as a new messaging service. Office infrastructure was moved entirely to the cloud. Satellite internet was set up to cover the risk of internet loss. The company then waited for reports on Russiaâs military moves.   On day one of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, MacPaw activated its risk mitigation plan.   âWe had to refocus our priorities,â Kosovan says. âThe first of them was, of course, the safety of our people, and then the continuity of our business.â   A code freeze regime was implemented for all products and infrastructure, with no changes permitted without prior approval from the emergency team.   Hardware management strategies also shifted. With supply chains disrupted, new laptops now had to be sourced from abroad. At times, system administrators had to drive to remote locations and personally deliver laptops to team members.   As wartime conditions became routine, the team adapted to their new reality. Nowadays, their biggest challenge is Russiaâs relentless attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.   The strikes cause frequent and protracted power outages. In MacPawâs home town of Kyiv, daily blackouts of eight hours have become commonplace, leading more team members to work from the office. To keep operations running, the company has installed extra power and internet access lines. A backup generator has also been acquired, alongside an uninterrupted internet access point via Starlink.   âStarlink helps a lot,â Kosovan says. âIt is one of the saving factors for Ukraine.â   The new measures have kept MacPawâs systems running throughout Russiaâs attacks on Ukraineâs power grid. But the human impacts have been harder to resolve.     The recovery process   Windows have been covered in wooden panels to protect what remained inside MacPawâs office.

People are breaking sometimes, and it is very hard to predict and help them.â   For months, staff in Kyiv have endured air strikes day and night. âPeople cannot sleep normally because they always hear these explosions in the airâ¦They donât know whether the next night a drone will hit their house or not.â   The brutality of the December missile attack was a stark contrast to the previous day at MacPaw. Staff had been preparing holiday gifts for  Children of Heroes , an organisation that supports Ukrainian children who have lost parents in the war.   Through the  MacPaw Foundation , the company also provides Ukrainians with non-lethal aid, including protective gear, IT equipment, and medical supplies. Since 2022, the non-profit has distributed over $12mn in total support   Alongside the humanitarian projects, Kosovan is helping to sustain the countryâs IT sector. Heâs personally invested in almost 20 Ukrainian businesses, including Osavul, a Kyiv-based AI  startup  that analyses information threats.   Formed to counter Russian propaganda, Osavul now offers services to governments and businesses alike. âOur goal is to review the narratives, show which of them are dangerous, and then give you all the intelligence to understand what you can do,â Dmytro Bilash, the startupâs co-founder,  told TNW  last year.   In combat zones, Ukrainian tech also has a powerful impact. Innovations range from a growing fleet of domestic drones to Delta, a battlefield management system. Developed by the military, the  software  combines a variety of tools, from digital maps to secure communications.Â    Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Yelyzaveta Boiko describes the system as âGoogle for the military.â âGoogle helps to organise your workspace, DELTA helps to organise your war space,â she  said  last year.   Beyond the theatre of war, MacPaw has sought to preserve Ukraineâs tech heritage. The latest result is  Innovation in Isolation  âÂ a book that chronicles the countryâs IT history.   The past and future of Ukrainian tech   Oleksandr Kosovan remains optimistic about the future of Ukrainian IT. Credit: MacPaw   Released in Europe and the US last month,  Innovation in Isolation  explores Ukrainian tech from the 1940s to today.   Through archival research, interviews with IT luminaries, and vivid photography, the book unravels the countryâs digital evolution. The stories span from cybernetics pioneers to modern innovators such as Grammarly and  Reface .Â    All proceeds from the book will go to humanitarian relief efforts through the MacPaw Foundation. Yet the project is not solely a charitable endeavour.Â    âItâs also important to talk about the history, because we all see how Russia tries to change the past by rewriting the history and claiming a lot of things as their own,â says Kosovan.   âMany things that were considered to be built in Russia or USSR were actually created by Ukrainians and Ukraine. This partially explains why there are so many great tech companies from Ukraine. We have a very rich heritage.âÂ    Even after missile strikes, that heritage continues to flourish.   âThere are many companies that emerge in these hard times,â Kosovan says. âHard times produce strong people. If companies can survive, despite the war and all its challenges, the company has a long-term future.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Story by                                                                                                                                                                    Thomas Macaulay                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Managing editor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thomas is the managing editor of TNW.

Spectrum blasted off at 12:30 PM CEST (11:30 BST) but lost control at about 25 seconds into the flight. A video from the launch shows the rocket wobble, pitch over, and then plummet back to the ground, where it collided with the ocean, causing a large explosion. The launchpad remains intact and no one was injured, Isar said.     Drone and pad footage from Isar Aerospaceâs Spectrum launch.

Isar Aerospace said the aim of the launch was âto collect as much data and experience as possible.â   The 28-meterÂ (91-foot) Spectrum is a two-stage launch vehicle designed to propel small and medium-sized satellites into orbit.   The company expects to produce as many as 40 rockets per year from its new factory, which is currently under construction outside its headquarters in Munich. Spectrum launch vehicles 2 and 3 are already in production, Isar said.   Spectru mâs in augural flight marks the first-ever ver tical orbital  rocket launch i n cont inental E urope  outside Russia.     V ir gin Orbit a ttempt ed an  orbital la un ch from the UK  in 2 0 2 3, but Â the plan failed. E uropeâs  other rockets, Aria n e  6 and  Vega C, launch from Europeâs main  space port in F rench Guiana,  South America .   Isar Aerospace  is the   first  private  space company to use AndÃ¸ya Spaceport, which officially  opened Â in 2023. The spaceport, loc ated close  to the Arctic Circle , offe rs easy access  to  polar and su n-sync hronous orbits  â i deal for Earth observation Â and  spy satellites.   Isar Aerospace signed a deal in February with  the N orwegian Sp ace Ag ency  to lau nch its  Arctic Ocea n Surve illance   (AOS) prog ram satellites until 2028.  The com pany l ooks to la unch up  to 15 missions per year from  And Ã¸ya, at a cost of aro und â¬1 0mn per flight.   Opening up orbital launches from Western Europe promises to simplify logistics for European satellite operators by eliminating the need to ship payloads overseas. Access to smaller, cheaper launch vehicles that can place a single satellite in orbit could also offer a more flexible, fast, and precise alternative to ride-sharing.   Then there are the geopolitical considerations. Launching from continental Europe would reduce reliance on foreign launch providers like SpaceX, enhancing sovereign access to space amid growing geopolitical tensions.   Metzler touched on  that point in a statement last week: âIn todayâs geopolitical climate, our first test flight is about much more than a rocket launch.â   Founded  in 2018  as a spin-off   f rom Techni cal University Munich, Isar Aerospace has secured â¬400mn to date, making it Europ eâs mo st  well- f unded  private  space company.   While AndÃ¸ya is Europeâs first continental spaceport, others are underway, the most advanced being the  SaxaVord spaceport  in the Shetlan d Island s off Scotland.   Rocket Factory Augsburg, a rival to Isar,  was m eant to launch from the site last year.  Howeve r, the startup suffered a major setback after its  rocket exploded   during   a st atic-fire test , pushing back  its in augu ral f light to later this year.Â Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Story by                                                                                                                                                                    SiÃ´n Geschwindt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            SiÃ´n is a climate and energy reporter at TNW.

    "body": "Five high-flying scaleups from the Benelux region have made it into TECH5 âÂ the âChampions League of Technology.â   The classy quintet joins an exclusive group of Europeâs fastest-growing tech companies. Over the next two months, they will join six other regions â the Nordics, Southern Europe, France, the Baltic States, DACH, and the UK & Ireland â in a competition for the crown of hottest scaleup on the continent.Â    The contest will conclude on June 19-20, when the TECH5 champion will be announced on the main stage of  TNW Conference . But first, the contenders have to win their regional title.   The challengers from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were selected based on an analysis of their growth, impact, and future potential. Our evaluation led us to the following five finalists, listed in random order:   1. DataSnipper   The ð of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! DataSnipper  has emerged as a shining star of Dutch tech. Over 500,000 audit and finance professionals across more than 125 countries now use the scaleupâs AI-powered software, which automates repetitive finance and audit procedures.Â    The company was profitable early on, scaled rapidly, and recently hit a $1bn valuation. Under the leadership of CEO Vidya Peters âÂ one of the  star speakers  at this yearâs TNW Conference â DataSnipper has be,en ranked by Deloitte as the fastest-growing tech firm in the Netherlands for two years in a row.   After finding success in Europe, the company has expanded globally, opening new offices in New York, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Mexico City. âThatâs been a huge component of DataSnipperâs growth,â Peters  told TNW  last month. âAnother is investing in AI.â   2. Dexter Energy   Dexter Energy  plans to transform the renewable energy landscape. To achieve this grand ambition, the scaleup provides AI-driven forecasting and trading-as-a-service for the short-term trading cycle. By making renewables trading profitable, Dexter Energy wants to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more affordable energy future.   âWith our products, we empower energy companies across Europe to unlock the full  potential of their wind, solar, and battery portfolios, maximising efficiency, profitability,  and sustainability,â the company told TNW.   These plans have progressed rapidly since Dexter Energy was founded in Amsterdam in 2017. Last year, the scaleup reduced emissions equivalent to those produced by 100,000 households â a figure thatâs been doubling annually.   3. Gorilla   Representing Belgium,  Gorilla  is reinventing the operations of energy retailers. The company supplies clients with real-time data and analytics, which lead to faster pricing, smarter decisions, and full visibility from sales to hedging.Â    âOur ambition is to become the commercial brain of energy retail,â Gorilla told TNW. âThe impact? A more agile industry that can actually keep up with climate, policy, and consumer change.â   Founded in 2018, the Antwerp-based scaleup has partnered with many of the worldâs top energy providers, including Shell, ScottishPower, ENGIE, and Centrica Business Solutions. Investors have been impressed by the progress. Last year, Gorilla raised â¬23mn in a Series B round led by US VC firm Headline.   4. Eye Security   Top-tier cybersecurity is often inaccessible to SMEs. Enterprise-grade solutions can be prohibitively expensive and complex. As a result, countless companies are left vulnerable to cyber threats.Â    Eye Security  plans to change that. The Dutch scaleup combines a 24/7 managed security operations centre (SOC), integrated cyber insurance, and expert-led incident response to streamline safeguards for SMEs.   The companyâs founders have deep experience with digital threats. Before launching Eye Security in 2020, all three of them were national security employees. Theyâre now focused on supporting the most vulnerable businesses. âOur approach simplifies protection â combining advanced threat detection with insurance in one seamless service,â the team told TNW.   5. Gain.pro   In the lucrative world of private market intelligence,  Gain.pro  aspires to set the global standard. The Amsterdam-based fintech has developed a platform that unearths powerful insights to guide investment decisions.Â    Inside the platform, human curation and generative AI combine to find, understand, and track companies that matter to each user. The benefits have attracted an illustrious list of clients â including all the MBB (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) and Big 4 (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC) advisory firms.   âOur platform brings together verified public information and proprietary insights, empowering users to focus on high-value work that truly sets them apart,â Gain.pro told TNW. âIn doing so, weâre making the world of M&A more transparent, efficient, and fair.â   Whatâs next for the TECH5 scaleups?   All five of these scaleups would make worthy winners for Benelux, but only one can triumph. The victor will be announced soon.

    "body": "Google DeepMindâs reported clampdown on sharing research will stifle AI innovation, warns the CEO of Iris.ai, one of Europeâs leading startups in the space.   The UK-based lab has tightened its rules on releasing AI studies,  the  Financial Time s reported  this week.  Citing seven current and former DeepMind scientists, the newspaper said the company has introduced stricter vetting and additional bureaucracy, making it harder to publish research . The changes aim to protect the companyâs edge in AI, the sources said.   Acquired by Google  in 2014 , DeepMind has long been a leader in computer science breakthroughs. In recent years, however, the lab has faced increasing competition from the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek.  Under growing pressure to stay ahead, the company is reportedly erecting new barriers around its innovations and reputation.   The new constraints have alarmed  Anita SchjÃ¸ll Abildgaard , co-founder and CEO of  Iris.ai , a Norwegian startup developing an AI-powered  engine for science . She fears DeepMindâs restrictions will hinder technological advances.

The impact on AI   On first impression, the changes at DeepMind may appear beneficial for other AI labs. The companyâs pioneering  innovations  and enormous citation counts have overshadowed other researchers in the field, who could now receive a larger share of the spotlight. But Abildgaard warns the drawbacks will far outweigh the benefits.   âResearchers across industries will have less access to DeepMindâs undoubtedly impressive work,â she said.   She pointed to the example of DeepMindâs  AlphaFold , a system that predicts protein structure with remarkable accuracy. The software has been  hailed  as a solution to one of biologyâs biggest mysteries, with potential to fuel countless advances, from discovering new drugs to tackling climate change.   âItâs hard to imagine projects of this importance being released so readily under this new diktat,â Abildgaard said.   The impacts, she warned, could be severe. In response, she urged AI companies to strengthen their commitment to openness.   âEurope, in particular, has one of the most fertile open-source research communities in the world,â she said. âAs DeepMind looks inwards, smaller research communities can differentiate themselves from the American giants by embracing collaboration.â   Europeâs AI sector features prominently in the  agenda  forÂ  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

    "intro": "Ahead of his talk at TNW Conference, healthcare expert Lucien Engelen shared his vision for the future of workplace perks",
    "date": "2025-04-01 10:01:00",
    "body": "Gone are the days when a bean bag and free kombucha made your office cool. Todayâs top tech talent wants something far more valuable: their health. Thatâs the view of Lucien Engelen, a renowned healthcare innovation expert, who believes workplace wellbeing is about to spark a seismic shift. This transition will not only transform employment perks, but also create a new tech market.   Engelenâs vision draws on deep experience.Â Across three decades in healthcare, his work has spanned acute care, ambulance services, and dispatch centres. As the founding director of the REshape Center of the Radboud University Medical Center, he spent eight years developing and implementing healthcare technologies, grabbing headlines for efforts to  integrate patients  in their own care and improve service provision  with social media .   Today, he focuses on running Transform.Health, which assists organisations such as Vodafone, Erasmus University Medical Center, Deloitte, and Sanofi in their healthcare strategies. He also delivers 100 keynotes a year across the globe about the subject.    These roles revealed a fundamental flaw in conventional treatment. âWeâve built a sick care system, not a healthcare system,â he says.   Engelen compares the problem to bad plumbing.   âWe wait until water gushes out of the wall before fixing the leak, instead of turning off the tap.â  Robert Doornbos (FR driver), Pernilla SjÃ¶holm (Tinder Swindler survivor) & more Check out every speaker at TNW Conference including Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI & Datasnipper                           Take me there                         For Engelen, the fix is obvious. We need to shift the focus from treating illnesses to preventing them. And employers have a crucial role to play.   At  TNW Conference  on June 19, Engelen will share his vision in full during a talk titled âCODE RED: Why the Future of Work is the Future of Health.â Ahead of the event, he shared a glimpse of what to expect.   Employers as catalysts for wellbeing   The business case for staff wellbeing is obvious: healthier employees deliver higher performance. Illness, stress, and long waits for medical care drain their productivity and availability.   âIf it takes eight weeks to get a consultation, thatâs eight weeks of lower productivity,â Engelen notes. âAnd if they leave due to poor health, replacing them can cost about â¬40,000 in rehiring and training someone to reach the same level.â   To stay ahead, forward-thinking employers are getting proactive. Instead of waiting for health problems to arise, theyâre offering services that can prevent them.Â    Technology is rapidly expanding the possibilities. From digital wellbeing  apps  and fitness trackers to online therapy, these perks are becoming a competitive advantage in attracting elite workers.Â    As Engelen says, âWeâre all fishing in the same bucket of talent.â   To attract that talent, he urges  employers to apply a broader concept of wellbeing. âItâs not only about your physical health. ThereâsÂ also your mental health, and even your social health and financial health.â     Gradually, this holistic model is shaping modern  workplaces.   The next generation   For employers, mental health services have become a growing focus â and with good reason. Deloitte research found that UK organisations investing in mental health support see an average return of  five to one .   The benefits could be especially impactful for younger workers. A  recent study  by PwC found that almost four in 10 Gen Z employees in the UK have seriously considered leaving their jobs in the last year, with mental health âa major driver.âÂ    Digital services offer promising solutions. Yet they also introduce new challenges.   âThe same Gen Z that is willing to step down due to mental health concerns also thinks privacy is very important â for the right reasons,â Engelen says. âThe challenge now for companies is offering solutions without sacrificing their privacy.â   Engelen sees employers addressing this by offering third-party services that staff can use confidentially, away from the prying eyes of bosses or colleagues. For instance, theyâre providing anonymised access to online mental health services and fitness apps connected to gyms outside the company â with no  data  flowing back to the business.   This growing focus on employee wellbeing also has powerful potential for  tech  firms. Engelen envisions a new market emerging for them.   âWeâll see an increase in Big Tech closing big contracts with big corporates,â he says.Â    âWe will also see Big Tech acquiring more startups in this sector than ever before, because they can not only get this technology scaled, but also access a market that is willing to pay for it. Now that employers see the real financial benefit of this, it is going to create a new revenue stream.â   For tech companies, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same is true for employers.Â    The future of wellbeing in the workplace   The benefits of healthy workplaces are well-established. Researchers have found that the ROI on employee wellness programs  can be  six to one.Â    âEmployers are realising that investing in prevention is far cheaper than paying for treatment or replacing talent â and can also attract talent,â Engelen explains.   Accessibility to digital wellbeing is also set to increase. Integration layers are connecting more and more healthcare apps, creating new approaches to medical care. The EU, meanwhile, recently ratified the European Health Data Space regulation, which will enforce mandatory access to medical records on usersâ smartphones.   As the technology progresses and enters the workplace, the ripple effects could improve lives and productivity, while alleviating pressure on overburdened health systems.   By embracing wellbeing tech, Engelen believes employers can accelerate a shift from reactive healthcare to proactive prevention.   âThe technology is already there,â he says. âWhatâs changing is how weâre using it. Employers have realised that investing in health and wellbeing is not just good for their people â itâs good for business.â Â    Lucien Engelen will be among the  standout speakers  at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

    "body": "One of Europeâs leading climate tech VC firms has called for a âfundamental redesignâ of traditional computing methods amid surging energy consumption  fromÂ AI applications.   The Berlin-based World Fund warns that simply transitioning data centres to renewable power will not be enough to fully decarbonise AI compute.Â    âWe need to rethink the way we go about computing, from the materials and chips we use to software we run,â Daria Saharova, founding partner at World Fund, said at the  Future  of Green Computing  event in Munich today.Â Â    At the event, World Fund joined Dealroom and Intelâs deeptech accelerator Ignite to unveil a new report that proposes a set of emerging technologies â from chips made in space to  processors that mimic the brain â to curb AIâs enormous appetite for energy and usher in a new era of greener computing.Â    3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

It identifies 65  startups  in this space, 54 of which are European, which have collectively raised $900mn. Over half of these companies were founded within the past five years, with 12 emerging in just the last 12 months.Â    A greener vision of AI   The report highlights three key technologies that hold the most potential to decarbonise AI.Â    The first is advanced semiconductor materials such as Gallium Nitride (GaN), Silicon Carbide (SiC), and graphene. These could significantly reduce AIâs energy consumption by improving efficiency and thermal performance in computing hardware.Â    One of the leading innovators in this space is Welsh startup  Space Forge . The company is leveraging the microgravity, vacuum, and extreme temperatures of space to produce semiconductors that it claims are three to five times purer than those made on Earth.Â    âWeâve pushed the efficiency of silicon chips to their limit,â said Joshua Western, CEO and cofounder at  Space Forge .   Another promising avenue lies in new computing paradigms, such as quantum, neuromorphic, and optical computing.  Quantum computers , for instance, promise to solve complex calculations much faster than classical machines, potentially reducing computational time and overall energy consumption.Â    âClassical computers are getting too big, too expensive, and use too much energy and water,â said  InÃ©s De Vega ,  VP of innovation at  IQM , Europeâs best-funded quantum computing startup.  âQuantum computing can both find new solutions to  climate change  but also drastically reduce the overall energy consumption of computing itself.â   Another type of computing gaining traction is optical computing, which leverages photons â particles of light â instead of electrons. It could dramatically increase processing speed, as demonstrated by Germanyâs Black Semiconductor. The companyâs photonics processors could transmit signals 100 to 1,000 times faster than traditional electronic chips.   Anastasiia Nosova, a former chip engineer at German semiconductor giant  Infineon  and host of the  Anastasi In Tech podcast, argued that  photonic chips could be 100 times more energy efficient than regular silicon semiconductors. âThey are one of the most important developments in computing right now,â she said at the Munich event..Â Â    While hardware fixes will be critical, thereâs also work to be done in advanced software that makes AIâs energy use more efficient. One of the startups working on this is London-based Deep Render. The company uses  deep learning  to compress files while retaining quality beyond what was previously possible. This reduces the volume of data that needs to be transmitted or stored, and thus the amount of computing power required.Â    While these technologies hold potential, theyâre still in the nascent stages of development. Meanwhile, the energy needed to train AI models is doubling every three to four months,  according to OpenAI .Â Â    âFor these computing solutions to scale in Europe, we need a lot of venture capital but also government backing,â said Saharova. She believes that Europe needs to allocate about  â¬1 trillion to bring climate tech, including green computing, to the âlevel it needs to be.âÂ    The future of AI will be a hot topic at  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

The US slapped a 20% tariff on imports from the EU â twice the rate for the UK. Switzerland fared even worse, receiving a hefty 32% levy.Â    Several European tech firms,  investors , and analysts told TNW that the measures could disrupt supply chains, force pricing adjustments, and stem the flow of transatlantic VC capital â plunging European tech companies big and small into uncertainty.   âTrumpâs trade tariffs will have a huge impact on the global tech landscape, forcing startups to reconsider their headquarters and assess alternative markets,â said Louis Fearn, principal and sustainability lead at InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover.Â Â    Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI, Monzo & Datasnipper Check out the NEW speakers for TNW Conference 2025 on June 19 & 20.                           View the Speakers                       For companies with hardware-dependent models, the tariffs represent a major cost challenge. Miika MÃ¤kitalo, CEO of Finnish firm HappyOrNot, which makes customer feedback terminals, noted that nearly half of the companyâs business is across the pond. He said the tariffs might force the firm to consider âinitiating assembly and production in the United States.â   Although the tariffs only apply to physical goods, service-based startups will also feel the impact.Â    Benjamin Avraham, founder and CEO of Swiss fintech Okoora, said there are many âsecondary effectsâ that will harm the âsmaller startup communityâ indirectly. These include changes in supply chains, barriers to VC investments, and increased volatility in exchange rates.Â Â    Software could also suffer from additional constraints. Amanda Brock, CEO at open-source lobby group OpenUK, said that while software has long been characterised as an intangible service, it âmay be subject to other trade restrictions.âÂ    The fallout has already begun. Trumpâs tariffs have sent markets into disarray and risk compounding existing tensions in global trade. Stocks  have plunged  around the world and countries  have promised  retaliatory measures. âThe newly announced blanket tariffs by President Trump create more uncertainty in the global tech industry,â said Martin Hartley, Group CCO of international tech consultancy Emagine. âThese measures could make businesses in the EU avoid the US altogether to sidestep additional costs.â   For European startups, the tariffs may force a stark strategic choice. âTrump is playing with fire,â warned Matt Penneycard, partner at UK-based Ada Ventures. âStartups selling to US customers now face two options: anchor in Europe and embrace its stability, or find ways to maintain access to the States by setting up operations there.âÂ    He added that this moment could be an opportunity for Europe. âAs the US becomes a tougher place to operate, top talent may follow stability â this is Europeâs moment to build a new Silicon Valley.â   European startups are the heartbeat of  TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

    "body": "âHello, I will be your driver for today,â says Bartek Szurgot, a software engineer at German startup Vay and my chauffeur for this ride. He disengages the handbrake, gently presses the accelerator and the new Kia Niro EV Iâm sitting in slowly pulls out of the parking lot.Â Â Â    As we approach the first intersection, Bartek indicates, turns the steering wheel, makes his observations, and drives out onto a busy road near the centre of Berlin. So far, pretty standard  â except for one big difference.   Bartek isnât in the car. Heâs in an office a few blocks away, controlling the vehicle like a high-tech puppeteer.     Remote operators like  Bartek  command Vayâs cars  from a video game-style  station equipped with a driverâs seat, steering wheel, pedals, and three monitors providing visibility in front of the car and to its side.Â    Hugging Face, ASML, OpenAI, Monzo & Datasnipper Check out the NEW speakers for TNW Conference 2025 on June 19 & 20.                           View the Speakers                       Road traffic sounds, such as emergency vehicle sirens and other warning signals, are transmitted via microphones to the teledriverâs headphones. Operators could be sitting on the other side of the world.Â    Vay has developed a proprietary hardware and  software  system called âdrive-by-wireâ that communicates with the carâs key controls, including the steering wheel, brake, and gear shifter. Electrical signals transmitted from the remote operating station tell the system what to do, enabling the car to mirror the remote driverâs actions in real time.Â    Redundant mobile networks  transmit the data. In the event of a network failure or emergency, the vehicle automatically comes to a safe stop.   Vayâs remote drivers spend most of their time delivering vehicles to customers, who hail the cars on an app. After the car arrives, users take the wheel and drive themselves.Â    Teledrivers control the cars from remote locations. Credit: SiÃ´n Geschwindt   Customers can use the car for a short trip, hours, days, or even longer. Once theyâre done, they stop the car safely in the road, apply the handbrake, get out, and carry on with their day. Then, a remote operator takes over again and drives on to the next client.Â Â Â    As anyone familiar with autonomous vehicles will know, watching a car drive itself takes some getting used to. Knowing that my âdriverâ was blocks away, steering through screens and sensors, made every turn feel surreal. But once you get used to it, the ride is almost disappointingly normal â I suppose thatâs the point.Â Â    Vayâs tech is impressive, no doubt, but in Europe, regulators may strangle its potential before it ever scales. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Vay is accelerating.   Vay already has  a 40-strong fleet of remote-controlled cars in Las Vegas. In Berlin and across Europe, though, progress has been slower, with no commercial service in place yet.Â    Due to regulatory red tape, Vay is limited to test drives only and is required to keep a safety driver onboard. It has previously received an exemption, though.  In 2023, it used one such regulatory hall pass to become  the first company  to operate a car on a European public road without a person inside. Â    However, the German government hands out such permits sparingly. Thatâs why I couldnât take the wheel on our test drive. That was Graemeâs job, our safety driver for the trip. Nevertheless, it gave me a firm idea of what to expect.   Cameras are attached to Vayâs cars. Credit: SiÃ´n Geschwindt   The future of car sharing?   When I first heard of Vayâs remote driving concept a couple of years back, I was skeptical. The company touted the benefits: less hassle, cheaper fares, better working conditions for workers. But it seemed like a business model at risk of fading into irrelevancy once self-driving cars went mainstream.   But with my mind fixated on the paradigms of ride-hailing on one hand and full autonomy on the other, I may have overlooked that Vay was doing something radically different.   âWeâre creating a whole new category of mobility,â Thomas von der Ohe, Vayâs CEO  and co-founder, tells me from the companyâs headquarters in Berlin. After spending years  in the Bay area building self-driving cars, he came back to Europe, founding Vay in 2018 alongside Fabrizio Scelsi and Bogdan Djukic.Â    Vayâs rides in Las Vegas cost about half as much as  Uber . Von der Ohe says they keep prices low by reducing driver labour costs. With ride-hailing services, itâs one driver, one car. But a single Vay driver can oversee up to 10 vehicles on any given day. When they drop one car at a customer, the drivers can âteleportâ and gain control of another vehicle.Â    Vay could offer a taxi-style service where passengers ride in the back, but that would cut into profits and drive up prices. Thatâs why letting customers drive themselves makes business sense, says Von der Ohe.Â    Vay aims to make its biggest impact in car sharing and rentals, not ride-hailing. Von der Ohe says the company can match average car rental prices in Germany while helping rental firms cut costs by reducing the need for large parking facilities, especially at busy airports.Â    Vay also hopes to provide a better version of car sharing. Customers donât need to pick up or park their cars â major hassles in dense European cities. Fleet owners can keep vehicles in use longer, and Von der Ohe believes the model could even reduce private car ownership in urban areas.Â    All this makes for a compelling value proposition. Vay has raised $150mn in funding so far, including  â¬34mn  ($37mn) from  the European Investment Bank.Â    But there are still many potholes in the road. Outside Las Vegas, Vay is still unproven â and regulatory red tape isnât making things easier.Â    In Europe, governments have been slow to adopt rules for remotely driven cars. Currently, the vehicles are subject to much the same guidelines as autonomous vehicles â which are patchy at best. Â    âWe have the tech, it works, it could be all over Berlin and Europe,â says Von der Ohe. âBut politics get in the way, thereâs no consensus. Itâs just so weird.âÂ    Vay has completed over 10,000 trips in Vegas and  plans to scale its fleet of remote-controlled Kia Niros to 100 this year.  The company  recently secured a new production facility in Sin City where it will retrofit the cars with its drive-by-wire system and a relatively inexpensive set of cameras. To fund the expansion, the company is also lining up another funding round, says Von der Ohe.   After my test drive, I called an Uber to take me to Berlin Brandenburg Airport. As it rolled up, I couldnât help but wish it arrived empty â just waiting for me to jump in and take the wheel. Maybe one day. But for now, if I want that future, Iâll have to book a ticket to Vegas.

    "body": "On Thursday, Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration, hosted his first all-hands meeting with GSA staff since his appointment to the position by President Donald Trump. The auditorium was packed, with hundreds of employees attending the meeting in person and thousands more tuning in online. While the tone of the live event remained polite, the chat that accompanied the live stream was a different story. ââMy door is always openâ but weâve been told we canât go to the floor you work on?â wrote one employee, according to Google Meet chat logs for the event obtained by WIRED. Employees used their real names to ask questions, but WIRED has chosen not to include those names to protect the privacy of the staffers. âWe donât want an AI demo, we want answers to what is going on with [reductions in force],â wrote another, as over 100 GSA staffers added a âthumbs upâ emoji to the post. But an AI demo is what they got. During the meeting, Ehikian and other high-ranking members of the GSA team showed off  GSAi , a chatbot tool built by employees at the  Technology Transformation Services . In its current form, the bot is meant to help employees with mundane tasks like writing emails. But Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been pushing for a  more complex version  that could eventually tap into government databases. Roughly  1,500 people  have access to GSAi today, and by tomorrow, the bot will be deployed to more than 13,000 GSA employees, WIRED has learned. Musk associatesâincluding Ehikian and  Thomas  Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who now runs the Technology Transformation Services within GSAâhave put AI at the heart of their agenda. Yesterday, GSA hosted a media roundtable to show its AI tool to reporters. âAll information shared during this event is on deep backgroundâattributable to a âGSA official familiar with the development of the AI tool,ââ an invite read. (Reporters from Bloomberg, The Atlantic, and Fox were invited. WIRED was not.) GSA was one of the first federal agencies Muskâs allies took over in late January,  WIRED reported . Ehikian, who is married to a former employee of Elon Muskâs X, works alongside Shedd and Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Muskâs transition team at the company. Hollander is partners with Steve Davis, who has taken a leading role at DOGE. More than 1,835 GSA employees have taken a deferred resignation offer since the leadership change, as  DOGE continues its push  to reportedly âright-sizeâ the federal workforce. Employees who remain have been told to return to the office five days a week. Their credit cardsâused for everything from paying for software tools to buying equipment for workâhave a  spending limit of $1 . Employees at the all-hands meetingâanxious to hear about whether more people will lose their jobs and why theyâve lost access to critical software toolsâwere not pleased. \"We are very busy after losing people and this is not [an] efficient use of time,â one employee wrote. âLiterally who cares about this,â wrote another. âWhen there are great tools out there, GSAâs job is to procure them, not make mediocre replacements,â a colleague added. âDid you use this AI to organize the [reduction in force]?â asked another federal worker. âWhen will the Adobe Pro be given back to us?â said another. âThis is a critical program that we use daily. Please give this back or at least a date it will be back.â Employees also pushed back against the return-to-office mandate. âHow does [return to office] increase collaboration when none of our clients, contractors, or people on our [integrated product teams] are going to be in the same office?â a GSA worker asked. âWeâll still be conducting all work over email or Google meetings.â One employee asked Ehikian who the DOGE team at GSA actually is. âThere is no DOGE team at GSA,â Ehikian responded, according to two employees with direct knowledge of the events. Employees, many of whom have seen DOGE staff at GSA, didnât buy it. âLike we didnât notice a bunch of young kids working behind a secure area on the 6th floor,â one employee told WIRED. Luke Farritor, a young  former SpaceX intern  who has worked at DOGE since the organizationâs earliest days, was seen wearing sunglasses inside the GSA office in recent weeks, as was  Ethan Shaotran , another young DOGE worker who recently served as president of the Harvard mountaineering club. A GSA employee described Shaotran as âgrinning in a blazer and T-shirt.â GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by WIRED. Got a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87. During the meeting, Ehikian showed off a slide detailing GSAâs goalsâright-sizing, streamline operations, deregulation, and IT innovationâalongside current cost-savings. âOverall costs avoidedâ were listed at $1.84 billion. The number of employees using generative AI tools built by GSA was listed at 1,383. The number of hours saved from automations was said to be 178,352. Ehikian also pointed out that the agency has canceled or reduced 35,354 credit cards used by government workers and terminated  683 leases . (WIRED cannot confirm any of these statistics. DOGE has been known to share  misleading and inaccurate statistics  regarding its cost saving efforts.) âAny efficiency calculation needs a denominator,â a GSA employee wrote in the chat. âCuts can reduce expenses, but they can also reduce the value delivered to the American public. How is that captured in the scorecard?â In a slide titled âThe Road Ahead,â Ehikian laid out his vision for the future. âOptmize federal real estate portfolio,â read one pillar. âCentralize procurement,â read another. Sub categories included âreduce compliance burden to increase competition,â âcentralize our data to be accessible across teams,â and âOptimize GSAâs cloud and software spending.â Online, employees seemed leery. âSo, is Stephen going to restrict himself from working on any federal contracts after his term as GSA administrator, especially with regard to AI and IT software?â asked one employee in the chat. There was no answer.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-20 16:24:51",
    "body": "According to a  memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico  first reported , states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will âleverage blockchain technologyâ as part of its procurement process. âAll distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,â the memo reads. âThis approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.â The memo does not make clear what specifically this meansâif it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement. The memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trumpâs inauguration, the State Department  put the entire agencyâs staff on administrative leave ,  slashed its workforce , and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world,  including those doing lifesaving work . Since then a  federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction  against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department. The plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard. Few blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve  large-scale use  in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says thereâs a reason for thatâthe incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary. âIt feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesnât exist,â she says. âI donât think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldnât use existing tools.â Giulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. âThereâs no proven advantage that itâs cheaper or better,â he says. âThe way itâs been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82. There have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  ran a small pilot  to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been  tested in Kenya  by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the  Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS) . One representative from an NGO that uses blockchain technology, but wasnât authorized to speak to the media with regards to issues relating to USAID, says that particularly with regards to money transfers, stablecoins can be faster and easier than other methods of reaching communities impacted by a disaster. However, âintroducing new systems means youâre setting up a new burdenâ for the many organizations that USAID partners with, they say. âThe relative cost of new systems is harder for small NGOs,â which would often include the kind of local organizations that would be at the front line of response to disasters. The proposed adoption of blockchain technology seems related to an emphasis on exerting tight controls over aid. The memo seems, for example, to propose that funding should be contingent on outcomes, reading, âTying payment to outcomes and results rather than inputs would ensure taxpayer dollars deliver maximum impact.â A USAID employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says that many of USAIDâs contracts already function this way, with organizations being paid after performing their work. However, thatâs not possible in all situations. âThose kinds of agreements are often not flexible enough for the environments we work in,â they say, noting that in conflict or disaster zones, situations can change quickly, meaning that what an organization may be able to do or need to do can fluctuate. Raftree says this language appears to be misleading, and bolsters claims made by Musk and the administration that USAID was corrupt. âItâs not like USAID was delivering tons of cash to people who hadnât done things,â she says.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-13 19:57:46",
    "body": "At least 10 people associated with Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  are now working at the Social Security Administration, according to government records reviewed by WIRED; this includes a number of young engineers whose presence at the SSA has not been reported. The ballooning of DOGEâs presence at the federal agencyâwhich Bloomberg, citing sworn statements filed in federal court Wednesday, previously  reported âcomes as Musk and his cohorts are publicly  threatening social security benefits , citing unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud. The DOGE-affiliated personnel in question are currently listed in the agencyâs internal organizational chart. Background checks for two are still pending, according to a  filing  by the SSA in federal court in Maryland opposing a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by unions that would prevent DOGE from accessing SSA records. (A  sworn statement  attached to the filing from the SSAâs deputy commissioner of human resources claims that six of the background checks are still pending.) The operativesâwhom the government did not name in its filingâare, according to internal documents, Akash Bobba, Scott Coulter, Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, Antonio Gracias, Gautier Cole Killian, Jon Koval, Nikhil Rajpal, Payton Rehling, and Ethan Shaotran. This team appears to be among the largest DOGE units deployed to any government agency. Ten of the DOGE-affiliated staffers are listed as part of the same group within Microsoft Teams, which SSA employees use for internal communication, according to a screenshot shared with WIRED. They are listed as âIT Specialistsâ based at the agencyâs headquarters in Washington, DC, except for Bobba, who is listed as âFront Officeâ in the office of the chief information officer (CIO). Many of them have worked or interned at Musk companies such as Tesla and Space X, and the majority of them have also appeared at other government agencies in recent weeks, as part of  DOGEâs incursion into the government . Musk has made wild claims about the social security system, calling it a âPonzi schemeâ and falsely claiming that  millions of 150-year-olds were fraudulently collecting benefits . Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 and davidgilbert.01. According to the SSA court filing and accompanying  sworn   statements , seven of them have read-only access to several datasets including the  Master Beneficiary Record , which contains detailed information about individuals and their benefits. Those same DOGE representatives also have read-only access to Numident, a database containing information about everyone whoâs ever applied for a Social Security number, as well as data referred to as âTreasury Payment Files Showing SSA Payments from SSOARS.â (The Social Security Online Accounting and Reporting System is a set of systems containing âinformation on the SSAâs financial position and operations,â  according  to the SSA.) These records contain a great deal of personally identifying and financial information; in filings the government says DOGE accessing them is necessary to âdetect fraud.â While itâs been unclear even to well-placed insiders what specifically DOGE is doing inside the Social Security Administration, Musk has repeatedly voiced his desire to  âeliminateâ  large parts of the system in the US, recently claiming that the fact that there are more Social Security numbers than there are US citizensâa  well-known quirk  of the SSA systemâ âmight be the biggest fraud in history .â Sources have told WIRED that one of the tasks the DOGE cohort will be assigned is how people identify themselves to access their benefit payments. Experts with decades of experience at the agency are now worried that DOGE operatives working across multiple agencies increases the risk of SSA data being shared outside of the agency or that their inexperience will lead to them breaking systems entirely. In the SSA filing, lawyers for the agency claim that the DOGE operatives have âno access to SSA production automation, code, or configuration files.â A  previous sworn statement from Tiffany Flick , the agencyâs former acting chief of staff, claims that its CIO, Michael Russo, was DOGE-aligned and demanded that Bobba be given access to âeverything, including source code.â Last month, President Donald Trumpâs administration  appointed Russo  as the SSAâs new CIO, despite his having no apparent previous government experience. Russo came to DOGE from payments company Shift4, which was founded by Jared Isaacman, Trumpâs nominee to run NASA. The office of the CIO works on âimplementation of a comprehensive systems configuration management, database management and data administration program,â according to the agencyâs own website, and is responsible for strategic planning. According to an  affidavit filed on Friday as part of a lawsuit  designed to halt what the suit called DOGEâs âunprecedentedâ seizure of SSA data, Flick outlined how she tried to educate Russo on how information at SSA is handled and the measures in place to prevent fraud. âMr Russo seemed completely focused on questions â¦ based on the general myth of supposed widespread social security fraud, rather than facts,â Flick said, adding that Russo was unwilling to understand SSAâs complex systems and instead seemed fixated on conspiracy theories about fraud within the system, such as Muskâs claim that millions of  150-year-olds were receiving benefit payments . Flick also wrote that she was ânot confidentâ that DOGE operatives had âthe requisite knowledge and training to prevent sensitive information from being inadvertently transferred to bad actors.â Flickâs affidavit named Coulter and Bobba as two of the DOGE associates joining SSA, alongside Russo. Coulter was a New Yorkâbased hedge fund manager whose fund, Cowbird Capital, was shuttered last year,  according to Business Insider . (Coulter appears to be the DOGE lead at SSA. While the affidavit from the deputy commissioner of human resources doesnât name him, it does identify the lead as a worker detailed from NASA, and Coulter is the only one of the 10 DOGE workers listed in internal NASA records reviewed by WIRED.) Gracias, another private equity figure who is now part of the  DOGE team at SSA , is the founder of Valor Equity Partners. Men named Jon Koval and Payton Rehling are listed on Valor's website as a vice president and a data engineer, respectively. Gracias, Koval, and Rehling donât seem to have any prior government experience, but Gracias does have a long history with Muskâhe worked at Tesla for 14 years as a company director and helped Musk take the company public. Gracias spent time with Musk at Mar-a-Lago ahead of Trumpâs inauguration and later described their conversations about how they believed the government functioned, on the  All In  podcast. (âIt's broken now. And so literally, money is flowing out,â went one confusing Gracias claim, about how money is moving from the Treasury department to other agencies.) Later, Gracias mentioned ââthe SSA. âThe only audit that I've seen is actually from the Social Security Administration. When you read it, I've got one of the partners who have read the thing, it's just riddled with material weaknesses.â Many of the other DOGE names listed in SSAâs internal records have  previously been reported by WIRED  as young, inexperienced technologists working at other government agencies. Individuals having access to the records of multiple agencies is highly unusual and problematic, experts say. âFederal law places strict controls on personal data held by agencies, including limits on cross-agency transfers and rigorous training requirements for personnel who have a legitimate need for access,â says John Davisson, the director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. âIgnoring those safeguards and haphazardly putting systems at multiple agencies under the thumb of a single engineer obliterates those protections. Theyâre hotwiring the federal government with a total disregard for privacy and data security.â Bobba, a former Palantir intern and recent UC Berkeley graduate,  was first appointed to the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) before moving to the General Services Administration (GSA). According to Flickâs testimony, âThere were challenges with Mr. Bobbaâs background check that took a few days to resolve.â Flick did not expand on what those issues were but stated that Bobba was eventually granted access to sensitive SSA systems after Russo and Musk lieutenant Steve Davis directly pressured top SSA administrators. The acting commissioner was ultimately replaced by Leland Dudek, a mid-level staffer who was, Flick asserted, on leave after having communicated with DOGE outside normal channelsâsomething he later bragged about in a LinkedIn post. Farritor , a 23-year-old former Thiel Fellow and Space X intern who helped to recruit other young engineers to join DOGE on a Discord group for SpaceX interns, has also appeared internally at the GSA, the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Education. Rajpal, a former Twitter and Tesla employee, now at the SSA, has also appeared  at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , OPM, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. WIRED previously reported  that Elez, a 25-year-old engineer also on the SSA list, at one point had read and write access within the federal payment system at the Treasury Department. He was also deployedÂ at Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security, according to  The New York Times . Elez briefly  resigned from DOGE  after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by  The Wall Street Journal,  but returned after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X. Shaotran, another young DOGE employee, is a 22-year-old Harvard student and a runner-up at an xAI hackathon. (xAI is Muskâs artificial intelligence company.) He has been deployed at GSA and the Department of Education and was recently onboarded at the  Department of Housing and Urban Development , according to internal documentation. Killian is a 24-year-old former computer science student who matriculated at McGill University and has been part of DOGEâs work at  the Environmental Protection Agency  and GSA, as well as the SSA. The SSA did not respond to a request from WIRED about what the DOGE operatives are working on inside the agency. In a Tuesday meeting, United States DOGE Service administrator Amy Gleason told staff that Musk-affiliated engineers and some legacy USDS workers would be headed to SSA to improve âidentity proofing,â say sources who were in the meeting. The US DOGE Service is a permanent rebranding of the US Digital Service. Identity proofing is the process SSA uses to identify that users are who they say they are in order to access their benefits. The process includes registering with identity apps such as the governmentâs own Login.gov or third-party services such as ID.me. At a meeting last week,  according to The Washington Post , Dudek, the SSAâs acting commissioner, told staff that the âDOGE peopleâ were effectively in charge of day-to-day operations at the agency and âwere going to make mistakes.â He also made it clear that he had been in direct contact with the White House. âI work for the president,â Dudek said, according to a longer recording of the meeting  obtained by ProPublica . âI need to do what the president tells me to do. Iâve had to make some tough choices, choices I didnât agree with, but the president wanted it, and I did it.â In February, Dudek outlined plans to  fire 7,000 employees  at the SSA and close more than half of the agencyâs regional offices, while  confirming  that many of the SSAâs most senior staff were departing. This week, the agency  reportedly  gave up on the idea of fully abandoning phone service for clients after The Washington Post reported on the plan. The SSA houses a highly complex system built on decades-old technology and contains some of the most sensitive personal information held anywhere within the US government. The threat posed by DOGE engineers making mistakes within these systems, experts say, is huge. Martin OâMalley, a former SSA commissioner,  warned last week , following DOGEâs incursion, that within months the SSA system could âcollapseâ and recipients would see âan interruption of benefits.\" This warning was repeated by Flick, who wrote in her affidavit that DOGEâs lack of knowledge of the SSA systems, âcombined with the significant loss of expertise as more and more agency personnel leave, have me seriously concerned that SSA programs will continue to function and operate without disruption.â âItâs a valid fear that personally identifiable information will be exfiltrated or source code messed with without necessary controls and rigor,â John McGing, a former SSA employee who worked at the agency for almost four decades, tells WIRED. Additionally, DOGE has  imposed a $1 spending limit on federal credit cards , which has led to some regional SSA offices experiencing issues buying basic supplies, including paper and toner, according to details shared with WIRED by one SSA employee. âWe have started rationing paper,â the source says. âPeople like to ask for four copies of their benefit verification letter. Weâve been giving them one and telling them to make their own copies.â The provision of sign language interpreters for appointments at the SSA have also been interrupted due to the $1 spending limit. âWe have to go back to that client and tell them we canât provide an interpreter, even though everything on our website says we will provide that,â the source said, citing an incident that happened this week. SSA staff are also now unable to order death certificates, which are used to verify whether someone within the system is dead or not, according to an email reviewed by WIRED. The source added that the office is also unable to pay the company that shreds mountains of documents it prints out on a daily basis, raising fears that piles of paper with highly sensitive personally identifiable information could soon be left lying around the office.

    "body": "The Trump administrationâs Federal Trade Commission has removed four yearsâ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agencyâs landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed. On the FTCâs website, the page hosting all of the agencyâs  business-related blogs and guidance  no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Bidenâs administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws. One now deleted blog, titled  âHey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?â  explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giantâs algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTCâs claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled  â$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kidsâ data: A game changer for COPPA complianceâ  instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed  allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data  from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians. âIn terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,â a source familiar tells WIRED. Another removed FTC blog titled  âThe Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trustâ  outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Actâs rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog  won an award in 2023  for âexcellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.â The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trumpâs inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Muskâs tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have  started to roll out AI products like GSAi , a general-purpose government chatbot. The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place âwarningâ labels above previous administrationsâ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law. Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Fergusonâs criticisms center around the Republican partyâs  long-standing allegations that social media platforms , like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards,  The New York Times reported in December . In an interview with CNBC last week , Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. âIf companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,â he said. Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs. âThey are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companiesâ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,â the source familiar alleges. âI think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.â",

    "body": "As Americaâs most  decorated civil servants sipped cocktails in the presidential ballroom of the Capital Hilton, worrying about their table assignments and wondering where they fell in the pecking order between US senator and UAE ambassador,  Elon Musk  sat staring at his phone, laughing. Few of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nationâs code baseâor, better yet, scrap it altogether. Musk wasnât big on formalities, but heâd dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new âsproutsâ only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest. The social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called  Department of Government Efficiency , sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phoneâtalking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildingâs Secretary of War Suite. Heâd even had his video-gaming rig installed there. As Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal governmentâpeople like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname âBig Ballsâ; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Muskâs acquisition, where heâd once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto âFutuate cohortem urbanamââLatin for something like âFuck these city dwellers.â In Muskâs mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the governmentâs byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. Theyâd help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton:  Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms?  They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then:  What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs? In the days and weeks that followed, DOGE hit one part of the federal government after another. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Veterans Affairs; the Federal Aviation, General Services, Social Security, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric administrations; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service; the US Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Park Service and the National Science Foundationâall fell under Muskâs control. An estimated tens of thousands of federal employees were effectively fired or resigned. âThis is a digital coup,â one USAID source told WIRED at the time. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32, velliott88.18, dell.3030, DavidGilbert.01, Kateknibbs.09, or dmehro.89. Along the way, DOGE also gained access to untold terabytes of data. Trump had given Musk and his operatives carte blanche to tap any unclassified system they pleased. One of their first stops: a database previously breached more than a decade ago by alleged Chinese cyberspies that contained investigative files on tens of millions of US government employees. Other storehouses thrown open to DOGE may have included federal workersâ tax records, biometric data, and private medical histories, such as treatment for drug and alcohol abuse; the cryptographic keys for restricted areas at federal facilities across the country; the personal testimonies of low-income-housing recipients; and granular detail on the locations of particularly vulnerable children. What did DOGE want with this kind of information? None of it seemed relevant to Muskâs stated aim of identifying waste and fraud, multiple government finance, IT, and security specialists told WIRED. But in treating the US government itself as a giant dataset, the experts said, DOGE could help the Trump administration accomplish another goal: to gather much of what the government knows about a given individual, whether a civil servant or an undocumented immigrant, in one easily searchable place. WIRED spoke with more than 150 current and former federal employees, experts, and Musk supporters across more than 20 agencies to expose the inner workings of DOGE. Many of these sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about what DOGE has doneâand what it might do next. Illustration: Sam Lyon Musk and Trumpâs  relationship was cemented on July 13, 2024, when a would-be assassin came within inches of killing the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk was impressed by the photo of Trump, blood streaming down his face, raising his fist in the air and shouting âFight, fight, fightâ for the cameras. The image quickly became a memeâMuskâs love language. He endorsed Trump that day and pivoted his recently launched super PAC to get the former president reelected. The following month, during a live discussion on X, Musk floated the idea of working for Trump on a âgovernment efficiency commission.â Trumpâs response was enthusiastic. âYou're the greatest cutter,â he said admiringly. Two years earlier, after Musk purchased Twitter in a chaotic blitz of last-minute paperwork and hundred-million-dollar money transfers, he had cut roughly 80 percent of the companyâs staff, closed at least a dozen international offices, and rolled back Twitterâs content moderation policies in the name of free speech. He demanded change at such speed that one of his lieutenants, Steve Davis, took to sleeping at Twitterâs San Francisco headquarters with his partner and their newborn baby. In Washington, Musk estimated that his team could cut ânearly $2 trillionâ from the federal budget. After you set aside nondiscretionary spending such as Medicare and Social Security benefits and interest payments on the national debt, that number, $2 trillion, was a little more than what you had left over. In other words, Musk was functionally proposing to cut  everything  else, from foreign aid to housing subsidies, from the maintenance of national parks to the collection of basic weather data, from investigations into predatory lenders to the operation of air traffic control systems. After Trump won, he announced that Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, would colead DOGE. The announcement kicked off a stealthy recruiting process, led by Davis, the same executive whoâd slept at Twitter HQ. Musk pictured a team of super-high-IQ individuals joining him in Washington for an 80-hour-a-week, 18-month hackathon on the US government. The DOGE brain trust camped out on the eighth floor of the SpaceX office in Washington, DC, commandeering multiple conference rooms and conducting meetings and interviews with DOGE hopefuls, according to a person with knowledge of the events. One question for applicants: Who did you vote for in 2024? Among Davisâ early recruits was Zsombor (Anthony) Jancso, a San Franciscoâbased engineer and former Palantir employee in his mid-twenties. After Palantir, Jancso had worked on a project called Accelerate X, which purported to offer âa modern OS for governmentâ with solutions âdelivered in days.â His cofounder, an MIT-educated engineer named Jordan Wick, joined DOGE too. A few weeks after the 2024 election, an online handle associated with Jancso reached out to a group of people who had participated in an AI challenge put on by the US Space Force. The person said they were looking for âhardcore engineersâ and instructed applicants to send their GitHub or LinkedIn to @DOGE on X and reply privately with their X handle. (To do all this, theyâd need to pay for  X premium .) Not long after that, the same handle posted in a group for Palantir alums: âThis is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3.â Luke Farritor, a 23-year-old engineer, quickly joined in the DOGE recruitment effort. The son of an academic at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a physician, Farritor was homeschooled and filled his childhood bedroom with books by James Baldwin and Jordan Peterson. During college he got prestigious internships at SpaceX and took to wearing his SpaceX T-shirt all the time. Later, Farritor came to a certain nerdy prominence for his role in using machine learning to decipher an ancient papyrus charred by the same volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii. He said his work received support from a $2 million gift from the Musk Foundation, and Musk backed it on X. The papyrus project also helped earn Farritor a Thiel Fellowship last springâa $100,000 grant funded by the oligarch and meant to encourage bright young people to drop out of college, which Farritor promptly did. On December 5, Farritor posted in a Discord group for SpaceX interns, noting that DOGE was looking for âskilled software engineers (and ops people) at any career stage who are willing to work for ~6mo in person in DC. Paid.â He added: âWeâre going to fix the government!â Musk, meanwhile, was spending time at Mar-a-Lago and getting a crash course on American civics, as taught by an array of Washington bureaucrats, venture capitalists, and right-wing shitposters on X. One of Muskâs advisers was Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor and early Tesla backer, who later summarized what theyâd learned on a podcast: âA department just basically asks for money from Treasury and they send it out.â Of course, the truth was a lot more complicated. Before the Treasury cuts a check, the payment authorization has to pass through an array of bespoke technical systems built up over decades to ensure that the money Congress appropriates is properly spent by the executive branch. The system is inefficient by design, so as to provide backstop after backstop. To Musk, that meant it was ripe for disruption. (His adviser Gracias would go on to become a DOGE âIT specialistâ at the Social Security Administration.) Still, Musk seemed to grasp that heâd been cavalier in setting his goal at $2 trillion. Government spending factors into gross domestic product; that level of cutting, the economist Dean Baker told WIRED, would represent a hit to the economy akin to the 2008 financial crisis, with the potential to produce double-digit unemployment. By mid-January, Musk  suggested  that $1 trillionâa sum merely greater than the entirety of nondefense discretionary spendingâwas a reasonable aim. He started to home in on individual government agencies. He seemed especially eager to eviscerate USAID, the governmentâs primary instrument for foreign aid. The right-wing conspiracy theories heâd eventually repost on X portrayed it as a criminal enterprise, a tool of the deep stateâs woke agenda. As Trumpâs second inauguration drew near, Muskâs and Ramaswamyâs visions for DOGE started to sharply diverge. Ramaswamy advocated an incremental approach: Push for changes in law that would eventually cut off spending at the source. Musk didnât want to wait around for that. Increasingly, his plans seemed in line with a scheme that incoming vice president JD Vance had laid out in a podcast interview in 2021: Fire all midlevel civil servants and replace them with Trump loyalists. Just before Trump officially took office, Muskâs vision won out, and Ramaswamy left the organization. Trump officially established DOGE on the afternoon of his inauguration. He effectively pasted it on top of the US Digital Service, an Obama-era agency set up to attract private-sector talents into a few years of civil work. Now the  D  in USDS would stand for âDOGE.â The order also established another organization within itâthe US DOGE Service Temporary Organizationâthat would expire on July 4, 2026. This would give DOGE the ability to bring in special government employees, people who would serve for a limited time before returning to the private sector and who, critically, would not be subject to the same transparency requirements as regular government workers. As Trumpâs presidency began, the DOGE brain trust broke camp at SpaceXÂ headquarters in DC. An employee who was there says they left a menâs bathroom âtrashed.â One of the urinals was âfilled with gum and Zyn.â Illustration: Sam Lyon Daisy Kid Henderson  first heard from DOGE around 9:30 pm on Inauguration Day, when she received an email inviting her to a meeting with anonymous staffers the following afternoon. Henderson, a fiery 28-year-old software engineer at the USDS, describes herself as an âeternal optimist.â Still, she found the lack of names on the invite disconcerting. Henderson, who is based in Denver, had been working for the USDS since January 2024. She landed there after a seven-year stint at Comcast, where her job involved everything from quantum computing to robotics to an audio algorithm for filtering sounds that people with PTSD or autism might find triggering. For Henderson, USDS was a chance to take a breath and reevaluate her career while doing some good. âIt was my dream job,â she recalls. âWhen I was hired on, it was even better than I imagined.â Henderson had overseen three generative AI pilot programs at the Department of Homeland Security. One, created for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, helped local officials plan and apply for disaster aid funding. She also partnered with the Food and Nutrition Service to help a number of states more quickly deliver assistance to low-income families. By the time Hendersonâs appointment with DOGE rolled around, she recalls, âthey had been doing these meetings all day nonstop.â DOGE âhad four or five interviewers and worked in shifts,â Henderson says, likely in an attempt to churn through all 200 legacy USDS employees as quickly as possible. According to another USDS staffer, someone had tried asking the interviewers for their last names, and the reply had been: âThis is a one-way conversation. We won't be answering any questions.â One question the DOGE people seemed to be asking everyone:  What do you think about DOGE? Henderson tried to stay positive as her call with the two young DOGE operatives began. They introduced themselves by their first names only, Cole and Ram. (That was Cole Killian, a 24-year-old who had attended McGill University, and Nikhil Rajpal, the former college libertarian and X employee.) As the men asked Henderson about her projects, they seemed particularly interested in her AI-related work for FEMA and her technical abilities. Then the questions took a strange turnâcentering around âwho the underperformers are at USDS,â Henderson recalls, and what skills she brought to her role. At one point, Killian simply got up and walked out of the room without a word. Rajpal carried on as though nothing had happened. Afterward, Henderson learned her colleagues had been asked whether they should keep their jobs. Similarly strange meetings were going on at the General Services Administration, another early DOGE target. If OPM was the federal governmentâs HR department, GSA was the operations and IT departments rolled into one. It oversaw more than 1,000 federally owned buildings, from anonymous office parks to minimalist masterpieces, along with hundreds of thousands of government vehicles and tens of billions in annual government purchasing. As would happen at agencies across the government, the GSA seizure took place in the shadowsâa matter not of announcements but of calendar invitations from unknown people, of unfamiliar names appearing in internal directories. The sixth and seventh floors, which had offices and suites used by the administrator, the âA-suite,â were restricted and largely locked down. No longer could employees simply badge in through the turnstile. Now they had to pass through metal detectors and have their belongings x-rayed. During that first week, GSA employees caught a glimpse of a whiteboard sitting in a large, vacant room with three items written on it: Spending Cuts $585 m Regulations Removed 15 Square feet sold/terminated 203,000 sf. No one in the rank and file seemed to know who wrote it or what it meant. As one of Muskâs top operatives at the GSA, DOGE installed Nicole HollanderâSteve Davisâ partner, the other parent of the newborn who slept at Twitter HQ. A former Tesla software engineer, Thomas Shedd, became the director of the GSAâs Technology Transformation Services, which operates dozens of crucial systems used across government agencies, including Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and the Federal Procurement Data System, a database that makes all unclassified government contracts above the micropayment level freely available to the public. DOGEâs strike force at GSA included Coristine, the young engineer known as âBig Balls,â and Farritor, the papyrus whiz kid. Another young DOGE recruit, Ethan Shaotran, also got a GSA email account and A-suite clearance. Shaotran had recently served as the president of Harvardâs mountaineering club. Heâd drifted into DOGEâs orbit at a hackathon for xAI, another company Musk owns. Soon it became clear that DOGE wanted GSA to adopt one product in particular: an AI chatbot that could plug into the agencyâs main portal, the Enterprise Data Solution. Such a tool would allow a handful of DOGE technicians to ask questions in plain language and get answers from vast stores of government data. (How this would accord with the GSAâs Internal Data Sharing Policy, which mandates that requests for certain kinds of controlled unclassified information must be approved by supervisors, was unclear.) To DOGE operatives unfamiliar with GSAâs systems, this might have seemed like a quick buildâparticularly if the team used an off-the-shelf large language model, like Claude or Gemini or Llama, as a starting point. But the engineers at GSA knew the project DOGE had in mind was far more complex than it seemed. The Enterprise Data Solution is a maze of disparate databases, analytical tools, and machine-learning systems, all with tightly controlled permissions. Creating even a quick chatbot that could tap into these datasets and produce useful answers was anything but trivial. During the Biden administration, employees at TTS had started exploring the possibility of building a simpler chatbot called GSAi, which they hoped would increase productivity by helping people write emails and eventually process contract and procurement data. By the end of Bidenâs term, though, there was no GSA chatbot on the horizon. âAnyone can build a chatbot today; it's really not that interesting,â a data scientist remarked during a February meeting about GSAi. A version of itâone that wasnât directly connected to EDSâwas set to go live soon. âThe interesting part is in the quality. Can we build a high-quality chatbot, one where our domain expertise is being applied?â To bridge the gap, GSA engineers proposed building what they called a discovery layer, an intermediary designed to decode user queries, identify relevant data sources, and generate precise searches that returned data the AI could interpret. The proposal, pitched to the A-suiteâthe select group that sources say includes DOGE members like Davis and Hollanderâwould also give GSA the ability to audit queries and check the quality of the responses. But for that to work, every database would need to be mapped, its columns and metadata described and categorized, ensuring the system understood what data lived where. None of this would happen automatically. It would be a manual, painstaking process. As the GSA engineers discussed the scope of what needed to happen, according to sources familiar with the events, they seemed deflated. DOGEâs timeline was unrealistic. âThis is a multiyear play,â one employee said bluntly in a meeting about the project, âand they think in terms of days and weeks.â A day after  the Alfalfa Club dinner, rumors were swirling that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would soon have its funding frozen. Grantees who already had their projects approvedâstate and county governments, nonprofitsâbegan aggressively drawing down their funding at an unprecedented scale. While HUD employees could have stopped the withdrawals, they didn't. And so, in the space of just a few days, around 1,400 grantees withdrew $1.5 billion in federal fundingâfive times the normal rate, according to data compiled from the agency's banking system and shared with WIRED. For Musk to gain what he seemingly most wantedâa âdeleteâ button he could wield against any agency by cutting off its funding at the sourceâhe would need direct access to the US Treasury. DOGE dispatched operatives to the Treasuryâs Bureau of Fiscal Service, which controls more than $5 trillion in disbursements, including Social Security and Medicare payments, tax refunds, and the salaries of federal workers. The operatives wanted access to two key systems: the  Payment Automation Manager  and the  Secure Payment System . David Lebryk, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury,  retired  rather than comply. The financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebrykâs retirement gave him a âpanic attack,â because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. Meanwhile, Farritor and a DOGE colleague had started showing up at USAID, one of Muskâs political bÃªtes noires. They carried backpacks with six or seven laptops each, sources familiar with the events told WIRED, and were allegedly instructed to access âemployee email accounts and all digital infrastructure,â according to a lawsuit later filed against DOGE on behalf of USAID employees. Initially turned away for lack of security clearance, they came back with a handwritten note on stationery from the Executive Office of the President saying they were suitable. On X, Musk called USAID a âcriminal organizationâ and said it was âtime for it to dieâ; Trump alleged that the agency was ârun by a bunch of radical lunatics.â According to  The Washington Post , Farritor and the other DOGE operative would run manually through payments, clicking off lifesaving programs. On February 3, Musk bragged that he had spent the weekend âfeeding USAID into the wood chipper.â Soon afterward,  as WIRED first reported  on February 4, a 25-year-old former X engineer named Marko Elez was granted the ability not only to read the code in the Treasury systems but also to writeâor changeâit. With that level of access, he (or anyone he reported to) could potentially have cut off congressionally authorized payments, effectively allowing Trump or Musk to exercise a line-item veto. More immediately ominous to people familiar with the systems was the possibility that, by tampering with the code, Elez could cause the systems, in whole or in part, to simply stop working. âItâs like knowing you have hackers on your network, but nobody lets you do anything about it,â a Treasury employee told WIRED. Illustration: Sam Lyon The fact of Elezâs read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention. Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, denied that DOGE had read/write access. In a  letter to Congress  that same day, Bessent wrote that members of the Treasury staff, including DOGE operative and Cloud Software Group CEO Thomas Krause, would have âread-only access,â which they needed to âcontinue this operational efficiency assessment.â But the letter didnât mention Elez, whom a Treasury employee described to WIRED as the âhands-on-keyboardâ person. (White House officials have gone  back  and  forth  about DOGEâs access to Treasury payment systems. This issue ended up in the courts. The cases are ongoing.) By early February, Elez came under fire after  The Wall Street Journal  found racist comments from accounts linked to him on social media. One suggested that â99%â of immigrant workers from India would be âreplaced by slightly smarterâ large language models. When the Journal asked whether Elez was connected to the account, he resigned. Later, with public support from Musk and Vice President Vance, DOGE rehired him. Before long, he was designated as an âIT specialistâ at another target of Muskâs: the Social Security Administration. DOGE had installed  a handpicked chief information officer at the SSAâthe former CTO of a payments company headed by Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who once commanded two trips to space using SpaceX rockets and is Trumpâs current nominee to lead NASA. That new CIO, Michael Russo, had asked to bring on Akash Bobba, the former Palantir intern who had been working out of OPM, as an engineer. But there were âchallengesâ with Bobbaâs background check, Tiffany Flick, the acting chief of staff to the acting administrator, later stated in a sworn affidavit given in a suit against the SSA. Bobba wasnât brought on immediately. By February 10, seven days after he was requested to be onboarded, phone calls and emails started to come inâfrom Russo, Steve Davis, and othersâmaking clear that Bobba was to be given access to SSA systems and data by the end of the day. As Russo and Davis âgrew increasingly impatientâ that evening, Flick recalled, Bobba was sworn in over the phone at 9 pm. Initially, Flick and officials from the CIOâs office determined that Bobba would be given anonymized, read-only access to records in the Numerical Identification System, which contains information on everyone who has ever applied for a Social Security number. On February 15, Bobba reported that there were issues with the dataset heâd been provided. Russo demanded that Bobba be given full access to âeverything, including source code,â Flick recalled. This included the SSAâs Enterprise Data Warehouse, which contains the ânames of spouses and dependents, work history, financial and banking information, immigration or citizenship status, and marital status,â according to Flickâs affidavit. Later that day, the chief information officer for the whole federal governmentâa political appointee working out of the Office of Management and Budgetâissued an opinion to Russo granting Bobba the access. Flick retired. In her affidavit, she expressed serious concerns about the potential for SSA records to be âinadvertently transferred to bad actorsâ and about âincredibly complex web of systemsâ being âbroken by inadvertent user error.â Over at the USDS, Daisy Kid Henderson had decided it was time for her to leave too. Since DOGEâs takeover, Henderson and her colleagues had had little contact with their new overlords. Each day, the legacy employees logged on to their government laptops to work on projects from the last administration, like generative AI for the IRS. One USDS worker said at the time that they did their best to âignore the clown show.â Then Henderson received another email from DOGE: They wanted to speak with her again the following morning. She was told they liked her enthusiasm and wanted to draw her closer into the fray. Henderson did not return their admiration. From what she had seen of DOGE, she says, they showed a âblatant lack of regard for the American peopleâs private data.â Henderson wanted no part of it. Instead of accepting the meeting, she forced-shut down her laptop and phone and didn't acknowledge the email until Monday, when she resigned. âI didnât want to be seen as being locked in with what DOGE was doing,â she says. âOn the flip side, if I was to stand up to them, or to say no, Elon Musk has shown that he is totally OK blasting and doxing employees and having that army descend upon me.â She responded to the email saying she had found a new opportunity in the private sector. She hadnât, but with her skills, it wouldnât be long before she did. âI was put in a position where, whether I chose to engage or not engage, I might have to cross ethical lines. I would have to breach the oath to the Constitution that I swore. I would have to breach my morals,â she says. âIt was clear I was going to be asked to join in on one of their tirades and work on a complete dismantlement of government systems.â Later that month, DOGE imposed a $1 spending limit  on federal employee credit cards . The move instantly roiled agencies from the National Park Service to the National Institutes of Health as employees scrambled to buy basic necessities to do their jobs. Yet again, DOGEâs move-fast ethos would put Americansâ personal data at risk. At one SSA office, a manager confirmed to his staff that he could no longer pay the company that shreds sensitive documents. âWe print a lot of shit daily,â one SSA employee told WIRED. âStuff with peopleâs names, addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, bank accounts, you name it. We have giant locking trash bins we put it in, and we pay a shredding company to empty them every month.â With the new $1 limit, the employee said, a âstockpileâ of sensitive data was growing, leaving workers with two options: âShred it ourselves on regular office shreddersâof which we have two, I think, and so it would take foreverâor just sit on it while it piles up.â Other employees at SSA told WIRED that rather than showing their anger at work where they could face retribution, they instead attended weekend protests at Tesla dealerships in DC, part of a nationwide protest effort to drive down the share price of Muskâs electric car company. On March 7,  DOGE got one of the things it seemed to want most from GSA: a chatbot that could automate work previously done by federal employees. The tool rolled out to some 1,500 employees at GSA, with an agencywide launch planned a week later. An internal memo about the tool touted the âendlessâ tasks it could help with: âdraft emails, create talking points, summarize text, write code.â The memo hinted at the dangers of deploying chatbots at the federal level, warning workers not to âtype or pasteâ internal or personally identifiable information as inputs. People who used it werenât impressed. âItâs about as good as an intern,â one GSA employee  told WIRED . âGeneric and guessable answers.â This version of GSAi almost certainly couldnât interact with the EDS discovery layer first proposed by engineers. More likely it was just the first step in an iterative approach. As one official said in the February meeting about the project, the first goal could be to âdeliver this sort of janky, doesnât-work-all-the-time chatbotâ to pave the way for a âturbo-chargedâ version down the line. Itâs unclear whether DOGE was on the same page. Around that time, GSA employees learned there were cuts on the way. âI encourage each of you to consider your options as we move forward,â wrote Stephen Ehikian, GSAâs acting administrator, whose wife had recently worked for Musk at X. âThe new GSA will be slimmer, more efficient, and laser-focused on efficiency and high-value outcomes.â Similar messages were going out across DC. The federal governmentâs funding was due to lapse on March 14, potentially triggering a shutdown. While Trump was busy lobbying House Republicans to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat until September,  WIRED reported  that Musk had expressed interest in a shutdownâin part because doing so would potentially make it easier to cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But hours before the House convened to vote on the resolution, Musk and Trump had apparently put their differences aside. They convened on the White Houseâs South Lawn to admire a small fleet of Teslas. Trump had recently posted that he planned to buy one. Of the protesters at Tesla factories who were speaking out against Muskâs work with DOGE, Trump said, âWeâre going to catch themâ and that they would âgo through hell.â The president and his richest ally walked around the cars, admiring the different colors, before getting into one. âEverythingâs computer!â Trump exclaimed, after sitting down. âThatâs beautiful.â It was Musk's car, but Trump occupied the driverâs seat.

    "date": "2025-03-17 18:43:03",
    "body": "An invitation to a â candlelightâ dinner  held this past Saturday at  President Donald Trumpâs  Mar-a-Lago club asked prospective guests to spend $1 million per seat. Trump attended the dinner along with  Elon Musk , according to multiple photographs and videos of the event viewed by WIRED. Elon Musk, wearing his standard uniform of a black sport coat over a black T-shirt, was seen shaking hands and waving to other attendees. He was with a woman wearing a floor length gown who appeared to be Shivon Zilis, according to Instagram Reels posted by multiple guests. Zilis, a Neuralink executive who previously sat on the board of OpenAI, is the mother of four of Muskâs 14 known children. (Zilis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Musk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency has  spent the last six weeks  ransacking federal agencies, sat next to Trump at the dinner. WIRED previously reported  on another candlelight dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the  presidentâs public schedule  with a note reading âthe President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.â The March 15 candlelight dinner did not appear on the official schedule. âYou are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest speaker President Donald J. Trump,â states the invitation, obtained by WIRED. â$1,000,000 per person.â The invitation has a âMAGA INC.â header and a note at the bottom of the invitation reads, âDonald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a special guest speaker and is not asking for funds or donations.â MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trumpâs 2024 presidential campaign. WIRED has also reported  that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a âhot ticketâ in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the event or the lack of the eventâs inclusion on the presidentâs official schedule. Got a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86 and zoeschiffer.87. Experts WIRED has spoken with about these candlelight dinners have noted concerns about their unusual nature. âI canât recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,â Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, previously told WIRED. âThe concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence. People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.â The candlelight dinner occurred over the same weekend as the Palm Event, an annual celebration of motorsports in Palm Beach, Florida. One of the celebrationâs weekend events occurred at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday afternoon and featured âstreet sportscars and cars with a motorsports heritage, one-of-a-kind, concept cars, celebrity-owned and cars with a racing history,â according to the  Palm Event website . A number of these cars appeared the night prior at the candlelight dinner, according to Instagram reels that featured guests milling around a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Lamborghini, among other luxury vehicles displayed on the lawn. The evening also coincided with a serious escalation in Trumpâs crackdown on immigration. On Saturday, while Trump and Musk dined with MAGA donors, a federal judge ordered the  White House  to stop the deportation of people the Trump administration alleged were Venezuelan gang members. Despite that ruling, two planes carrying the alleged gang members flew from Texas to El Salvador. Senior officials reportedly  told Axios  that the ruling held no force âbecause the flights were over international waters.â",

    "header": "The FBI Is Investigating Attacks on Tesla as âDomestic Terrorism.â Hereâs Why That Matters",
    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-22 06:30:00",
    "body": "The US Federal  Bureau of Investigation says itâs investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which âTesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.â On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at  Tesla vehicles  and, in at least one alleged incident, writing âprofane messages against President Trumpâ near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes. âLet this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,â Bondi said in a  news release  detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina. Civil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Muskâs role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations. Bondiâs announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots âTesla Takedownâ events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are  scheduled to take place  at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The  demonstrations  have multiplied since they began in  mid-February , with some attracting  hundreds of people  each. Most of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them  have   said  that they donât endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in  Colorado  and  Boston . By labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism,  the FBI can file  broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets âspecial authorities\" while investigating terrorism, including âsingle-jurisdiction search warrantsâ from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a  2023 report  from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get âconfidential education recordsâ from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes. The FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from  more than 30  federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies,  including  the âDepartment of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,â as well as local police throughout a particular region. In addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as  social media surveillance  tools,  face recognition  programs, and allegedly â stingrays â that can intercept data from cell phones. Most of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However,  some lawyers  have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases. Privileged Access There arenât explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems âdomestic terrorismâ incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. âIt would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,â German says. That could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that arenât available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation. Thereâs precedent for companies not only receiving information from law enforcement during domestic terrorism investigations, but also working directly with the FBI. German says this was particularly evident during the response to a wave of oil pipeline protests in the early 2010s. Records published by  the news site Grist  and Type Investigations found that the FBI considered one pipeline operator a âdomain stakeholderâ in one protest case, which gave the company âdirect access to the White Houseâ and privileged information. The company  was also invited  to strategize with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, National Guard, and local police. And there were conversations about how to âensure coordination and resource managementâ not only among law enforcement officials, but with the company. A different pipeline constructor hired a firm to  monitor and infiltrate  protest groups and write  intelligence reports , which were sometimes shared with federal law enforcement and local police, according to reporting by The Intercept. One of these pipeline operators briefed local police along its proposed pipeline route on how to  possibly pursue  criminal charges against organizers, Grist reported. Even after the protests waned, oil and gas companies remained close to police and the government. One Canadian pipeline company paid local Minnesotan police departments  more than $5 million  in 2020 and 2021 for policing pipeline protests. Since 2017, fossil fuel lobbyists  have pushed more than 20 states  to pass laws making disrupting âcritical infrastructureâ like oil and gas pipelines a criminal offense, according to records obtained by The Guardian. Though itâs unclear how the FBIâs current domestic terrorism investigations will play out, Musk and other Tesla executives could ultimately have similar access to and influence over them. When the cases go to court, Tesla could also be eligible for compensation from the government in the form of court-ordered restitution. Such funds are often used to pay the families of terrorism victims, but German tells WIRED that corporations are also eligible. In a successful criminal case, he says, he sees no reason why Tesla wouldnât get compensated. Tesla could also be eligible for money from state-level terrorism victim compensation programs, which  receive some  funding from the federal government. Risks for Protesters Domestic terrorism investigations are often fraught. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have  argued that  the FBI routinely uses them to unfairly surveil activists and communities of color without adequate oversight. President Trump has said his administration is taking Tesla incidents very seriously. âPeople that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders,â Trump wrote in a  social media post  on Thursday. âWE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!â Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLUâs national security project, says that instead of âfocusing on the most serious criminal conduct that harms life,â federal agencies have wasted resources and abused their authority by âtreating alleged non-violent civil disobedience or vandalism as justification for abusive investigations of civil rights and other activists.â Historically, German says, the FBI has endorsed an idea called âradicalization theory,â which posits that the beliefs of extremists naturally escalate from moderate and widely held beliefs. That logic, he says, justifies the FBI casting a wide surveillance net, particularly when it comes to monitoring activists. âThey suggest that anybody who's got a similar ideology might be willing to commit the same kind of crime,â German explains. âWe've seen a lot of abuse of FBI investigative authorities, particularly around domestic advocacy groups.â Five years ago, the FBI used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  to surveil people participating  in Black Lives Matter protests, investigating whether they had ties to terrorists. The  DOJ inspector general  called the incident an example of the FBIâs âwidespread non-complianceâ with FISA rules. German claims that in this case, instead of focusing on people who are alleged to have committed arson or acts of violence, the FBIâs focus could ultimately be scrutinizing people who it thinks are expressing âanger or animosity towards Tesla or Elon Musk.â",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-24 13:24:31",
    "body": "As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) continues to rampage through the United States federal government, essentially guided by  Elon Musk , the group has also been upending traditional IT boundariesâevaluating digital systems and allegedly accessing personally identifiable information as well as data that has typically been off-limits to those without specific training. Last week, The New York Times  reported  that the White House is adding Musk-owned SpaceXâs Starlink Wi-Fi âto improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex,â according to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House's Starlink internet service is reportedly being donated by the company. Spotty internet is an annoying but highly solvable problem that WIRED has  reported on   extensively . Of course, the White House is a highly complex organization operating out of a historic building, but network security researchers, government contractors, and former intelligence analysts with years of experience in US federal government security all tell WIRED that adding Starlink Wi-Fi in a seemingly rushed and haphazard way is an inefficient and counterproductive approach to solving connectivity issues. And they emphasized that it could set problematic precedents across the US government: that new pieces of technology can simply be layered into an environment at will without adequate oversight and monitoring. âThis is shadow IT, creating a network to bypass existing controls,â alleges Nicholas Weaver, a member of the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute's network security team and a computer science lecturer at UC Davis. He adds that while secret and top secret information is typically ( but not always ) processed only on special, separate federal networks that have no wireless access, the security and uniformity of White House Wi-Fi is still extremely important to national security. âA network like the White House unclassified side is still going to be very sensitive,â he says. âJust like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,â White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tells WIRED in a statement. A White House source who asked not to be named supported the switch, arguing that in some areas of the campus, âthe old Wi-Fi was trash.â Researchers point out that while Starlink is a robust commercial ISP like any other, it is not clear that it is being implemented in compliance with White House Communication Agency requirements. If the controls on the White House Starlink Wi-Fi are more lax than on other White House Wi-Fi, it could introduce security exposures and blind spots in network monitoring for anomalous activity. âThe only reason they'd need Starlink would be to bypass existing security controls that are in place from WHCA,â claims former NSA hacker Jake Williams. âThe biggest issues would be: First, if they don't have full monitoring of the Starlink connection. And second, if it allows remote management tools, so they could get remote access back into the White House networks. Obviously anyone could abuse that access.â One baffling aspect of the arrangement is that Starlink and other satellite internet is designed to be used in places that have little or no access to terrestrial internet serviceâin other words, places where there are no reliable fiber lines or no wired infrastructure at all. Instead of a traditional ISP modem, Starlink customers get special panels that they install on a roof or other outdoor place to receive connectivity from orbiting satellites. The New York Times reported, though, that the White House Starlink panels are actually installed miles away at a White House data center that is routing the connectivity over existing fiber lines. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED that this setup is bizarre. âIt is extra stupid to go satellite to fiber to actual site,â ICSI's Weaver says. âStarlink is inferior service anyplace where you have wire-line internet already available and, even in places which don't, inferior if you have reasonable line of sight to a cell tower.â Weaver and others note that Starlink is a robust product and isn't inherently unreliable just because it is delivered via satellite. But in a location where fiber lines are highly available and, ultimately, the service is being delivered via those lines anyway, the setup is deeply inefficient. While Starlink as a service is technically reliable, incorporating it in the White House could create a long-term federal dependence on an Elon Muskâcontrolled service, which could create future instabilities. After European officials raised concerns earlier this month on whether Starlink might stop serving Ukraine, Musk  posted  on social media: âTo be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals â¦ We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.â Updated at 3 pm ET, March 24, 2025, to add comment from the White House, additional details from a White House source, and further context around the transmission of classified materials.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-03 13:09:51",
    "body": "Following a White House edict effectively banning  federal employees  from disclosing their personal pronouns in email signatures, sources within multiple federal agencies say pronouns are now being  systemically blocked  across multiple email clients and other software. WIRED confirmed various automated efforts with employees at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the  General Services Administration  (GSA), the US Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The employees spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retaliation. Multiple agency directors sent emails over the weekend telling staff that, due to President Donald Trumpâs executive order, their offices would be removing the pronoun capability from Office 365. Employees were told theyâd also need to remove pronouns from their email signatures in order to comply with the directive. A staffer at USAID says the formal deactivation of their ability to list pronouns occurred last week, in response to executive orders defining sexes issued by President Trump on his first day in office. A GSA staffer says pronouns were wiped from employeesâ email signatures after hours on Friday and were also no longer visible in Slack, the workplace messaging app. At the CDC, there used to be a section for employees to share their pronouns on their Teams profiles, another workplace app. That field no longer exists. Reached for comment, the White House transferred WIRED to OPM communications director McLaurine Pinover, who pointed to  January 29 memorandum  ordering agencies to disable all features âthat prompt users for their pronouns.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee with a government agency impacted by this? Weâd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Dell Cameron securely at dell.3030 on Signal. The ban on personal pronouns follows sweeping efforts by the White House to eliminate programs that encourage diversity and social justice within the federal government, as well as other references to âdiversity, equity, and inclusionâ in federal employeesâ discourse. In a striking example of the policy in action, an image  surfaced last week  of a wall being painted over at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Quantico, Virginia, academy due to it listing \"diversity\" among the bureau's core values. (According to an email from the FBIâs Office of Integrity and Compliance  obtained by Mother Jones , the bureau no longer counts \"diversity\" among its core values.) The Trump administration began a radical campaign last week aimed at inducing members of the federal workforce to leave their jobs ahead of threatened reductions. The effort is spearheaded by Elon Musk, leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force that has effectively seized control of several federal agencies and sensitive government systems with apparent clearance from the White House. WIRED reported last week that Muskâs outfit had effectively taken over the  Office of Personnel Management , the US governmentâs human resources department. In this and other efforts, it is employing  inexperienced young engineers  whose ages range from 19 to 24âmany of whom, public records show, are former interns or have been affiliated with Musk-aligned companies. OPM  emailed federal workers  on January 28 with a âdeferred resignation offer,â sparking widespread confusion among federal workers. (DOGEâs own new HR chief was unable to answer basic questions about the offer in a contentious staff meeting last week,  WIRED reported .) In an email to staff Sunday evening, OPM clarified whether the deferred resignation program complied with existing privacy laws. âYes,â read the answer. âThe deferred resignation program uses only basic contact information about federal employees, like name and government address, along with short, voluntary email responses. The information is stored on government systems. To the extent that the Privacy Act applies, all information relevant to the program is covered by existing OPM System Records Notices.â Multiple agency sources  told WIRED last week  that several of Musk's lieutenants had been granted access to key computer systems controlled by the GSA, an independent agency tasked by Congress with overseeing federal buildings and providing equipment, supplies, and IT support across the government.

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-26 13:06:25",
    "body": "From the beginning of President  Donald Trumpâs  administration,  Elon Muskâs  so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had a plan to monitor USAID payments and was preparing to use  US Treasury Department systems  to halt them, according to new court documents, emails, and affidavits obtained by WIRED. Court documents in  Alliance for Retired Americans et al v. Bessent et al  and  American Federation of Teachers et al v. Bessent et al  reveal the extent of DOGEâs penetration into the most sensitive systems at the Treasury, including the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), and what exactly DOGE was hoping to accomplish. The bureau is nested within the US Treasury and handles most federal payments, to the tune of more than $5 trillion a year. WIRED first reported that Marko Elez, a former engineer at X, the social media company owned by Musk,  had read/write access  to two BFS systems: the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS). But documents now reveal that Elez also had âreadâ access to Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), an accounting system where federal funds are stored in pre-authorized accounts. Court documents shared by the government reveal Elez had access as of February 1. From court filings, it appears this access was in service of the administrationâs plans to target USAID. USAID was one of the  earliest targets  of DOGE and the Trump administration. Less than two weeks after Trumpâs inauguration, the majority of the agencyâs staff were  placed on administrative leave , and funding to many partner organizations  was cut off . The documents appear to show how plans were in place for this sudden strangulation in payments to happen. In a January 26 email between Matthew Garber, a top Treasury official, and the Treasury secretaryâs chief of staff, Garber outlined the new administrationâs plan to utilize BFS access to halt payments to USAID. âFiscal will intercept USAID payments files prior to ingestion into our PAM/SPS systems (this is in place now and can begin immediately),â Garber wrote. âWe developed a process to intercept the file, and additional flags to ensure we catch all USAID payment requests through our systems.â (This email chain was included as part of documents shared in the  Alliance for Retired Americans  lawsuit.) âFiscal will manually pull an unredacted and unmodified copy to share with State officials,â Garber continued, outlining plans from his team. \"State officials will review and provide a determination to Fiscal on whether or not to release the file into our normal payment processes.â A top  Treasury officialâs calendar  shows that a few days later, Elez arrived in Kansas City, one of the main BFS sites, and had a full docket of meet and greets and several deep dives with the teams responsible for each of the systems. The plan was for Elez to spend the next month at the facility to identify âopportunities to advance payment integrity and fraud reduction goals.â According to a planning sheet, which was also shared with the court, âonly (1) individual (i.e. the designated technical team member)ââwhich was Elezâârequires access to Fiscal Service systems and data at this time.â Records show that in the final days of January, a request was placed to grant Elez access to both systems. On January 31, David Lebryk, who had been acting Treasury secretary and at one point was the commissioner of BFS,  abruptly announced he would retire  after he had been placed on administrative leave for refusing to provide DOGE with access to these payment systems. For those who knew the Treasury intimately,  this set off alarm bells . That same day, according to an attachment provided by the government, at 6:07 pm, a ticket was filed disregarding a previous order just a day before to give Elez just read-only access: âsorry read/write is needed.â At the same time  Lebryk stepped away , DOGE gained access to the entirety of USAIDâs IT systems and network,  according to reporting from ProPublica . The next day, as the dismantling of USAID was underway, according to court documents, Elez was granted access to the source codes of ASAP, SPS, and PAM. He was also granted read-only access to the production database for the SPS and PAM. People with knowledge of Treasury systems tell WIRED that it would be uncommon, if not âunheard of,â for a BFS employee to have access to all these systems simultaneously. âWithin Fiscal, the mainframe guys donât have write access to the databases and vice versa,â says a former BFS employee who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. Normally, they say, employees at BFS are given the minimum amount of access to systems required to do their jobs. âNo BFS employee would normally have this kind of access.â Got a Tip?

According to an affidavit from another top Treasury official, though, that plan to isolate USAID payment files outlined by Garber was temporarily paused for the next several daysâthe State Department had decided it would instead intercept the files. However, on February 4 and February 5, USAID payments flowed to the PAM portal designed by Garberâs team. That same affidavit outlined the next steps: BFS was instructed to focus on flagging, quarantining, and sending several payments to State officials that fell under President Donald Trumpâs foreign aid  executive order  that stated there would be a 90-day pause on this aid as the State Department reviewed each program. This plan, according to an email chain included in one of the lawsuits, was vetted by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who was âcomfortable proceeding.â These payments, which originated from the Department of Health and Human Services, included funding for âRefugee and Entrant Assistance,â âGifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement,â and âRefugee Resettlement Assistance.â By then, Musk had doubled down on his contempt for USAID: In a  February 2 post on X , Musk wrote, âUSAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.â DOGE operatives, including Luke Farritor, a  young member , had gained âsuper administratorâ access to USAIDâs systems,  according to ProPublica . Farritor, who had also been at the  Department of Health and Human Services  as well as the General Services Administration (GSA), was reportedly going through USAIDâs payment system manually, shutting off agency funding,  according to The Washington Post . Elez was in the midst of a similar operation in Kansas City: According to that Treasury officialâs affidavit, the engineer began to manually identify and review the foreign aid payment files that had been sequestered in the folder Garber outlined in that late January email. Meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to give Elez even further access. A February 3 IT ticket, included in case documents from the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit, reveals that requests were made for Elez to access the  Central Accounting Reporting System , âthe electronic system of record for the governmentâs financial data.â That same day, a motion filed by the plaintiffs in  another lawsuit  alleges Elez copied and downloaded a pair of USAID files from the PAM database to his laptop; around that same time, an affidavit from the Bureau of Fiscal Serviceâs chief security officer said Elez emailed a spreadsheet with personally identifiable information to two GSA officials  via unencrypted channels . (Both of these actions are at the core of one of the lawsuits against Bessent and the Treasury Department; the plaintiffs in that suit were recently granted expedited discovery to access records related to Elezâs tenure at BFS.) A DOGE team had  already established a presence at the GSA , which  included Farritor , as well as former Tesla employee Thomas Shedd and other DOGE members Ethan Shaotran and  Edward Coristine . After WIRED reported on February 4 that Elez had unprecedented access to the Treasuryâs payments systems, Bessent  asserted in a letter to Congress  that Tom Krause, then a special government employee associated with DOGE at the Treasury, only had âreadâ access. Elez was not mentioned in that letter. In her memo granting a preliminary injunction in the  American Federation of Teachers  lawsuit, filed on March 24, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote, âaccording to a spreadsheet attached to a February 3, 2025 email from a Treasury executive point person for the engagement, as of February 1, Elez had access to Treasury systems including PAM, SPS, and ASAP, and it was recommended that his access to other Treasury systems be expanded.â On February 5, while Elez had access to Treasuryâs most sensitive systems, he received an email from the deputy assistant commissioner for enterprise IT operations noting that, though he had been issued a BFS laptop, he had yet to sign the bureauâs ârules of behavior.â (This email was included among documents shared by the government in one of the lawsuits.) Those rules include, following âlaws, regulations, and policies governing the use and entrance to such facilities,â and protecting any âFiscal Service data, equipment and IT systems from loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized use or disclosure.â Elez, it would appear, had already violated these rules by sharing the data with the GSA officials. The next day, Elez resigned after the  The Wall Street Journal  sought comment for a report about racist posts on social media accounts that appeared to belong to him. Elez is now one of the many DOGE operatives working at the  Social Security Administration . In late February, USAID said it would  cancel 90 percent  of the agencyâs contracts. The contract cancellations threw nonprofits around the world into  chaos  and slowed the response to  infectious diseases . Earlier this month, a federal judge said the  dismantling of USAID  âlikely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.â The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This week, Trump signed an  executive order  stating that all federal payments should be consolidated within the Treasury. The order claims that doing so will help fight fraud, waste, and abuse. Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, believes the order means that, âinstead of having to send some DOGE guy into an agency to control the payments, it all happens in one place. It moves power away from agencies and centralizes it in the White House.â In his order, Trump claimed that $1.5 trillion passes through other avenues, known as non-Treasury disbursing offices. These are nested within certain agencies that are able to disburse funds without going through the BFS system. Moynihan alleges that the strangulation of USAIDâs funding could be a âharbingerâ of potential changes at other agencies. The administration appears particularly focused, he says, on âthe president having absolute power and control over where money goes regardless of laws on impoundment or statutes on agencies.â âItâs a consolidation of power in the name of efficiency,â he claims.",

    "body": "The eye-popping scandal  surrounding the Trump cabinetâs  accidental invitation to The Atlanticâs editor in chief to join a text-message group secretly planning a bombing in Yemen has rolled into its third day, and that controversy now has a name: SignalGate, a reference to the fact that the conversation took place on the  end-to-end encrypted free messaging tool Signal . As that name becomes a shorthand for the biggest public blunder of the second Trump administration to date, however, security and privacy experts who have promoted Signal as the best encrypted messaging tool available to the public want to be clear about one thing: SignalGate is not about Signal. Since The Atlanticâs editor, Jeffrey Goldberg,  revealed Monday  that he was mistakenly included in a Signal group chat earlier this month created to plan US airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the reaction from the Trump cabinetâs critics and even the administration itself has in some cases seemed to cast blame on Signal for the security breach. Some commentators have pointed to reports last month of  Signal-targeted phishing by Russian spies . National security adviser Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the Signal group chat, has even suggested that Goldberg may have  hacked  into it. On Wednesday afternoon, even President Donald Trump suggested Signal was somehow responsible for the group chat fiasco. âI don't know that Signal works,â Trump  told reporters  at the White House. âI think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you.â The real lesson is much simpler, says Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher who has conducted audits on widely used encryption tools in the past as the director of the Open Crypto Audit Project: Donât invite untrusted contacts into your Signal group chat. And if youâre a government official working with highly sensitive or classified information, use the encrypted communication tools that run on restricted, often  air-gapped  devices intended for a top-secret setting rather than the unauthorized devices that can run publicly available apps like Signal. âUnequivocally, no blame in this falls on Signal,â says White. âSignal is a communication tool designed for confidential conversations. If someone's brought into a conversation whoâs not meant to be part of it, that's not a technology problem. That's an operator issue.â Cryptographer Matt Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more simply. âSignal is a tool. If you misuse a tool, bad things are going to happen,â says Green. âIf you hit yourself in the face with a hammer, itâs not the hammerâs fault. Itâs really on you to make sure you know who youâre talking to.â The only sense in which SignalGate  is  a Signal-related scandal, White adds, is that the use of Signal suggests that the cabinet-level officials involved in the Houthi bombing plans, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, were conducting the conversation on internet-connected devicesâpossibly even including personal onesâsince Signal wouldnât typically be allowed on the official, highly restricted machines intended for such conversations. âIn past administrations, at least, that would be absolutely forbidden, especially for classified communications,â says White. Indeed, using Signal on internet-connected commercial devices doesnât just leave communications open to anyone who can somehow exploit a hackable vulnerability in Signal, but anyone who can hack the iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac devices that might be running the Signal mobile or desktop apps. This is why US agencies in general, and the Department of Defense in particular, conduct business on specially managed federal devices that are specially provisioned to control what software is installed and which features are available. Whether the cabinet members had conducted the discussion on Signal or another consumer platform, the core issue was communicating about incredibly high-stakes, secret military operations using inappropriate devices or software. One of the most straightforward reasons that communication apps like Signal and WhatsApp are not suitable for classified government work is that they offer âdisappearing messageâ featuresâmechanisms to automatically delete messages after a preset amount of timeâthat are incompatible with federal record retention laws. This issue was on full display in the principalsâ chat about the impending strike on Yemen, which was originally set for one-week auto-delete before the Michael Waltz account changed the timer to four-week auto-delete, according to  screenshots of the chat  published by The Atlantic on Wednesday. Had The Atlanticâs Goldberg not been mistakenly included in the chat, its contents might not have been preserved in accordance with long-standing government requirements. In congressional testimony on Wednesday, US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard  said  that Signal can come preinstalled on government devices. Multiple sources tell WIRED that this is not the norm, though, and noted specifically that downloading consumer apps like Signal to Defense Department devices is highly restricted and often banned. The fact that Hegseth, the defense secretary, participated in the chat indicates that he either obtained an extremely unusual waiver to install Signal on a department device, bypassed the standard process for seeking such a waiver, or was using a non-DOD device for the chat. According to  political consultant and podcaster Fred Wellman , DOD âpolitical appointeesâ demanded that Signal be installed on their government devices last month. Core to the Trump administrationâs defense of the behavior is the claim that no classified material was discussed in the Signal chat. In particular, Gabbard and others have noted that Hegseth himself is the classification authority for the information. Multiple sources tell WIRED, though, that this authority does not make a consumer application the right forum for such a discussion. âThe way this was being communicated, the conversation had no formal designation like 'for official use only' or something. But whether it should have been classified or not, whatever it was, it was obviously sensitive operational information that no soldier or officer would be expected to release to the publicâbut they had added a member of the media into the chat,â says Andy Jabbour, a US Army veteran and founder of the domestic security risk-management firm Gate 15. Jabbour adds that military personnel undergo annual information awareness and security training to reinforce operating procedures for handling all levels of nonpublic information. Multiple sources emphasize to WIRED that while the information in the Yemen strike chat appears to meet the standard for classification, even nonclassified material can be extremely sensitive and is typically carefully protected. âPutting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, itâs also just mind-boggling to me that all of these senior folks who were on this line and nobody bothered to even check, security hygiene 101, who are all the names? Who are they?â US senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said during Tuesdayâs Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. According to The Atlantic, 12 Trump administration officials were in the Signal group chat, including vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Trump adviser Susie Wiles. Jabbour adds that even with ââdecisionmaking authorities present and participating in a communication, establishing an information designation or declassifying information happens through an established, proactive process. As he puts it, âIf you spill milk on the floor, you canât just say, âThatâs actually not spilled milk, because I intended to spill it.ââ All of which is to say, SignalGate raises plenty of security, privacy, and legal issues. But the security of Signal itself is not one of them. Despite that, in the wake of The Atlanticâs story on Monday, some have sought tenuous connections between the Trump cabinetâs security breach and Signal vulnerabilities. On Tuesday, for example, a Pentagon adviser echoed a report from Googleâs security researchers, who  alerted Signal  earlier this year to a phishing technique that Russian military intelligence used to target the appâs users in Ukraine. But Signal pushed out an update to make that tacticâwhich tricks users into adding a hacker as a secondary device on their accountâfar harder to pull off, and the same tactic also targeted some accounts on the messaging services WhatsApp and Telegram. âPhishing attacks against people using popular applications and websites are a fact of life on the internet,â Signal spokesperson Jun Harada tells WIRED. âOnce we learned that Signal users were being targeted, and how they were being targeted, we introduced additional safeguards and in-app warnings to help protect people from falling victim to phishing attacks. This work was completed months ago.\" In fact, says White, the cryptography researcher, if the Trump administration is going to put secret communications at risk by discussing war plans on unapproved commercial devices and freely available messaging apps, they could have done much worse than to choose Signal for those conversations, given its reputation and track record among security experts. âSignal is the consensus recommendation for highly at-risk communitiesâhuman rights activists, attorneys, and confidential sources for journalists,â says White. Just not, as this week has made clear, executive branch officials planning airstrikes. Updated at 5:50 pm ET, March 25, 2025: Added remarks about Signal by President Trump.",

    "body": "In a Monday morning meeting, Thomas Shedd, the recently appointed  Technology Transformation Services director  and  Elon Musk  ally, told  General Services Administration workers  that the agencyâs new administrator is pursuing an âAI-first strategy,â sources tell WIRED. Throughout the meeting, Shedd shared his vision for a GSA that operates like a âstartup software company,â automating different internal tasks and centralizing data from across the federal government. The Monday meeting, held in-person and on Google Meet, comes days after WIRED reported that many of  Muskâs associates have migrated to jobs  at the highest levels of the GSA and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Prior to joining TTS, which is housed within the GSA, Shedd was a software engineer at Tesla, one of Muskâs companies. The transition has caused mass confusion amongst GSA staffers who have been thrown into surprise one-on-one meetings, forced to present their codeâ often to young engineers who did not identify themselves âand left wondering what the future of the agencyâs tech task force will look like. Shedd attempted to answer these questions on Monday, providing details on a number of projects the agency will pursue over the coming weeks and months. His particular focus, sources say, was an increased role for AI not just at GSA, but at agencies government-wide. In what he described as an âAI-first strategy,â sources say, Shedd provided a handful of examples of projects GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian is looking to prioritize, including the development of âAI coding agentsâ that would be made available for all agencies. Shedd made it clear that he believes much of the work at TTS and the broader government, particularly around finance tasks, could be automated. \"This does raise red flags,â a cybersecurity expert who was granted anonymity due to concerns of retaliation told WIRED on Monday, who noted that automating the government isnât the same as automating other things, like self-driving cars. âPeople, especially people who arenât experts in the subject domain, coming into projects often think âthis is dumbâ and then find out how hard the thing really is.â Shedd instructed employees to think of TTS as a software startup that had become financially unstable. He suggested that the federal government needs a centralized data repository, and that he was actively working with others on a strategy to create one, although it wasnât clear where this repository would be based or if these projects would comply with privacy laws. Shedd referred to these concerns as a âroadblockâ and said that the agency should still push forward to see what was possible. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Sources say that during the call Shedd tightly connected TTS and the United States Digital Servicesârebranded as the United States DOGE Service, or DOGE, under Trumpâas âpillarsâ of a new technological strategy. Later in the meeting, he said that there was no plan to merge the two groups and that projects would flow through them both depending on available staff and expertise, but continued emphasizing the upcoming collaboration between TTS and DOGE. Employees, sources say, also asked questions about the young engineers, who had previously not been identifying themselves in meetings. Shedd said that one of them felt comfortable enough to introduce himself in meetings on Monday, sources say, though Shedd added that he was nervous about their names being publicly revealed and their lives upended. Shedd was unable to answer many staff questions about the deferred resignations, the return to office mandate, or if the agencyâs staff would face substantial cuts, according to sources. At one point, Shedd indicated that workforce cuts were likely for TTS, but declined to give more details. (Similar questions were also asked of Department of Government Efficiency leadership  in a Friday meeting first reported by WIRED .) Towards the end of the call, sources say, a TTS worker asked if they would be expected to work more than 40 hours per week, to deal with all of the upcoming work and potentially laid-off workers. Shedd responded that it was âunclear.â",

    "date": "2025-03-24 20:12:29",
    "body": "Shortly after senior  Trump  administration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in an  encrypted group chat  that, unbeknownst to them, included the editor in chief of The Atlantic, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent,  secret dinner  featuring the president where guests were asked to pay $1 million apiece to snag a seat. The date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate  attending a âcandlelightâ dinner  that wasnât on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting  Houthi leadership . At least 53 people, including children,  were killed . Trump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Muskâs 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the presidentâs brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing. The candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events. Details of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled âHouthi PC small group.â (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story,  The Atlantic reported  on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials. The day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a âmistake.â According to The Atlantic's reporting, Millerâwho WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as  âPM,â short for prime minister âeffectively shut down Vanceâs concern. âAs I heard it, the president was clear: green light,â an account with Millerâs initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. âAmazing job,â wrote Waltz. âA good start,â wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by âMARâ in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely âMarco Antonio Rubio,â wrote âGood Job Pete and your team!!â referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: âThe team in MAL did a great job too,â referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trumpâs team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago. About 45 minutes later, Trump confirmed the Yemen bombings. âToday, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,â he posted on  Truth Social . âThey have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones. ... To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DONâT, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!â John Bolton, Trump's fourth national security adviser from his first term, said on CNN that the entirety of the discussion about the military operation in Yemen âshould've been discussed in the Situation Room,â either in a principals committee meeting or a full National Security Council one. âHow can you conduct official government business over a nonofficial channel?â he asked. âWords fail me here. I cannot even imagine this happening.\" Got a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, Leak2Lahut.26, zoeschiffer.87, and timmarchman.01. The Department of Defense specifically  bars  Signal as a means of transmitting nonpublic DOD information unless previously authorized. Under  federal guidelines , security clearance and eligibility to hold a sensitive position can be revoked for negligent disclosure of protected information. In one  case , the government sought to deny clearance to a contractor in part because he left a laptop containing sensitive informationâit turned out to be an unclassified aircraft maintenance record and an unclassified emailâin the âunsupervised custody of a Peruvian national.â Under the Espionage Act, unauthorized disclosure of national defense information can be punished by a fine or imprisonment. In 2017, reporters for Gizmodo and ProPublica  demonstrated  that Trump properties, including Mar-a-Lago, had weakly encrypted and open Wi-Fi networks, a misconfigured router and server, and other glaring security vulnerabilities. At the time, attackers could have taken control of devices connected to Trump networks, according to the publications. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for a comment from WIRED; in 2017 it told Gizmodo and ProPublica that it adhered to âcybersecurity best practices.â In 2023, Trumpâs lawyers asked a federal judge to petition the Justice Department to  âre-establishâ a secure facility  where sensitive matters could be discussed at Mar-a-Lago. Whether this has happened isnât clear, but typically, an estate where the president spends a great deal of time would have a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, installed specifically so that the president and their advisers could discuss classified information securely, using government equipment. Personally owned electronic devices are  not allowed in SCIFs ; government- and contractor-owned ones are, but only under certain circumstances. The handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago became the subject of a federal investigation when the president was out of office: In early 2022, the National Archives alerted the Department of Justice that there were classified documents in 15 boxes that had been left at Mar-a-Lago, which triggered a property search six months later. Trump pleaded not guilty to 40 counts related to his handling of classified materials upon leaving office. A federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. WIRED previously reported on the dinner  on March 15 and another âcandlelightâ dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the  presidentâs public schedule  with a note reading, âThe President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.â The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about the dinner, security issues or federal guidelines involved with the Signal chat, and whether Waltz or any of the other chat participants will face disciplinary action. A senior administration official  told Politico  on Monday afternoon that âthey are involved in multiple text threads with other administration staffers on what to do with Waltz.â âAs President Trump said, the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,â White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an email to WIRED, repeating her earlier statement from Monday afternoon on The Atlanticâs story. WIRED has also reported  that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a âhot ticketâ in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.",

    "body": "One of President Donald Trumpâs first actions after taking office last month was to sign an executive order freezing foreign aid, much of which flows through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), an independent agency that represents less than 1 percent of the overall federal budget. The administration later said that âlifesavingâ work was  exempt  and could continue. But USAID employees and officials from nonprofit organizations say they are still being blocked from doing vital work on ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. The consequences may be dire: âAt a minimum, 300 babies that wouldnât have had HIV, now do,â one current USAID worker estimates. WIRED interviewed eight current and former USAID employees and contractors for this story, several of whom directly work on the agencyâs HIV and AIDS programs. They were granted anonymity due to fears of retaliation and because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency. USAID did not respond to requests for comment. Elon Muskâs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service has plowed through several government agencies since President Donald Trump took office last month, proposing  sweeping changes  to federal infrastructure. But no agency has been gutted as thoroughly as USAID. A cadre of  young DOGE agents  have been stationed in USAIDâs headquarters since last week; after reportedly  wresting control  of USAIDâs secure systems and placing key personnel on administrative leave, the DOGE team began cutting off staff email accounts on a rolling, seemingly random basis, with no guidance or explanation, employees claim. âItâs been absolutely hellish,â says a current USAID employee who lost access to their email on Monday morning. âWe spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,â Musk  said on social media  Sunday. âCould [sic] gone to some great parties. Did that instead.â One popular program implemented by USAID, however, has already been granted an âemergency humanitarian waiverâ to keep operating: the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The global health program, which was founded by former US president George W. Bush and is overseen by the State Department, has saved an  estimated 26 million lives  since its launch in 2003. Itâs implemented by a handful of government agencies, including USAID. While in theory the Trump administrationâs waiver allows the program to resume some of its activities while the foreign aid freeze is still in effect, in reality, sources tell WIRED that much of its lifesaving work remains paused. \"Your money is being unfrozen but you canât contact the people who actually froze it,\" a senior official at an HIV/AIDS organization told WIRED. \"Thereâs a bigger communication blockage that is frustrating even the efforts put in place to free up the lifesaving work.\" Large numbers of USAID employees have been  placed on administrative  leave or locked out of their emails and work servers in recent days, including those working on a variety of what they say are critical public health missions. USAID staffers say this demonstrates that the emergency waiver application process is ineffective and isnât ensuring that aid workers can continue serving vulnerable populations. USAID staff who still have access to their email accounts received a notice on Monday evening from Ken Jackson, the agencyâs assistant to the administrator for management and resources, saying that the agency âwould likely undergo a reorganizationâ and be integrated into the State Department. âAs we evaluate USAID and ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda, the President Trump Administration, and the efforts of the State Department, we will focus on ensuring every agency dollar is delivering targeted and results-driven aid,â the email read. In countries like Zambia, Nigeria, Haiti, and Mozambique, medical equipment ranging from antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV to pre-exposure prophylaxis and condoms that can prevent transmission of the disease are currently sitting in limbo, according to the same USAID worker who warned of a drastic uptick in the number of children living with HIV. The aid is unable to reach its destinations because the USAID workers tasked with logistics have been placed on administrative leave. âWhen a baby is born, you do an early infant diagnostic test, and if it comes back positive, you can blitz them with retrovirals, but you canât do that if you donât have retrovirals,â the same USAID worker says. âItâs an absolute disaster.â In Haiti, an aid worker confirmed that HIV/AIDS medication from USAID remains inaccessible. âWe cannot touch the medication,â they say. âEverything is on hold.â The worker added that nobody from USAID had answered their phone calls for days. âThe Trump administration is playing with tens of millions of people's lives, and Haiti is just one consequential example of that in our hemisphere,â says Asia Russell, the executive director of the international HIV advocacy group Health GAP.

While PEPFAR is the most well-known HIV/AIDS program implemented by USAID, the agency has a number of additional projects devoted to the issue. One current USAID worker whose research focuses on prophylactic devices primarily for women in sub-Saharan Africa says that their work has been interrupted, too. They say members of their team were abruptly cut off from their work emails this afternoon. âWe hadnât yet applied for a humanitarian waiver,â they say. âWe donât even have a way of contacting IT.â Democratic lawmakers and dozens of USAID employees protested in front of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, DC, on Monday after they were denied access to USAIDâs offices. âThis illegal, unconstitutional interference with congressional power is threatening lives all over the world,â  said  Maryland representative Jamie Raskin. A current USAID employee shared an email with WIRED they received from the agency on Monday night, informing them that USAID buildings in Washington will remain closed tomorrow. âWe will continue to provide further updates as they become available,â the email reads. âThank you for your cooperation.â",

    "body": "A 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, who previously worked for two  Elon Musk companies , has direct access to Treasury Department systems responsible for nearly all payments made by the  US government , three sources tell WIRED. Two of those sources say that Elezâs privileges include the ability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). Housed on a secure mainframe, these systems control, on a granular level, government payments that in their totality amount to more than a fifth of the US economy. Despite  reporting that suggests  that Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force has access to these Treasury systems on a âread-onlyâ level, sources say Elez, who has visited a Kansas City office housing BFS systems, has many administrator-level privileges. Typically, those admin privileges could give someone the power to log in to servers through secure shell access, navigate the entire file system, change user permissions, and delete or modify critical files. That could allow someone to bypass the security measures of, and potentially cause irreversible changes to, the very systems they have access to. âYou could do anything with these privileges,â says one source with knowledge of the system, who adds that they cannot conceive of a reason that anyone would need them for purposes of simply hunting down fraudulent payments or analyzing disbursement flow. \"Technically I don't see why this couldn't happen,\" a federal IT worker tells WIRED in a phone call late on Monday night, referring to the possibility of a  DOGE  employee being granted elevated access to a government server. \"If you would have asked me a week ago, I'd have told you that this kind of thing would never in a million years happen. But now, who the fuck knows.\" A source says they are concerned that data could be passed from secure systems to DOGE operatives within the General Services Administration.  WIRED reporting  has shown that Elon Muskâs associatesâincluding Nicole Hollander, who  slept in Twitterâs offices  as Musk acquired the company, and Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who  now runs a GSA agency , along with a host of  extremely young and inexperienced engineers âhave infiltrated the GSA and have attempted to use White House security credentials to gain access to GSA tech, something experts have said is highly unusual and poses a huge security risk. Elez, according to public databases and other records reviewed by WIRED, is a 25-year-old who graduated Rutgers University in 2021 and subsequently worked at SpaceX, Muskâs space company, where he focused on vehicle telemetry, starship software, and satellite software. Elez then joined X, Muskâs social media company, where he worked on search AI. Public Github repositories show years of software development, with a particular interest in distributed systems, recommendation engines, and machine learning. He does not appear to have prior government experience. Elez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Broadly speaking, the US government pays out money in one of two ways. Agencies like the Department of Defense and the US Postal Service are legally authorized to originate, certify, and issue payments on their own. The vast majority of payments, thoughâincluding federal tax returns, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and veteranâs payâflow through the Federal Disbursement Services, which according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a nonpartisan body, is charged with directing this money appropriately, moving it from government accounts to recipients. The Payment Automation Manager and the Secure Payment System are the mechanisms through which the money is paid out. Control of those mechanisms could allow someone to choke off money to specific federal agencies or even individuals, a fear that Democrats have expressed about DOGE. On Monday,  Senate Democrats warned  of DOGEâs encroachment into the payment system. âWill DOGE cut funding to programs approved by Congress that Donald Trump decides he doesnât like,â said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. âWhat about cancer research? Food banks? School lunches? Veterans aid? Literacy programs? Small business loans?â The fight over whether DOGE could access Treasury systems led to a  previously reported  standoff between acting Treasury secretary David Lebryk and Muskâs associates. Lebryk was placed on administrative leave last week and subsequently resigned. âLebrykâs resignation set an example,â a source tells WIRED. âAny idea of resistance or noncompliance seems to be fading in the wake of that, and everything I have heard from leadership suggests they intend to give the âDOGEâ operatives what they are asking for.â Updated, 2/4/2025, 11:45 AM EDT: WIRED has updated the article to clarify on which mainframe the systems are housed.",

    "body": "Federal employees are seeking a temporary restraining order as part of a class action lawsuit accusing a group of  Elon Muskâs  associates of allegedly operating an illegally connected server from the fifth floor of the US Office of Personnel Managementâs (OPM) headquarters in  Washington, DC. An attorney representing two federal workersâJane Does 1 and 2âfiled a motion this morning arguing that the serverâs continued operation not only violates federal law but is potentially exposing vast quantities of government staffersâ personal information to hostile foreign adversaries through unencrypted email. A  copy of the motion , filed in the DC District Court by National Security Counselors, a Washington-area public-interest law firm, was obtained by WIRED exclusively in advance. WIRED previously reported that Musk had  installed several lackeys  in OPMâs top offices, including individuals with ties to xAI, Neuralink, and other companies he owns. The initial lawsuit,  filed on January 27 , cites reports that Muskâs associates illegally connected a server to a government network for the purposes of harvesting information, including the names and email accounts of federal employees. The server was installed on the agencyâs premises, the complaint alleges, without OPMâthe governmentâs human resources departmentâconducting a mandatory privacy impact assessment required under federal law. Under the 2002  E-Government Act , agencies are required to perform privacy assessments prior to making âsubstantial changes to existing information technologyâ when handling information âin identifiable form.â Notably, prior to the installation of the server, OPM did not have the technical capability to email the entire federal workforce from a single email account. â[A]t some point after 20 January 2025, OPM allowed unknown individuals to simply bypass its existing systems and security protocols,â Tuesdayâs motion claims, âfor the stated purpose of being able to communicate directly with those individuals without involving other agencies. In short, the sole purpose of these new systems was  expediency .â OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee with a government agency impacted by this? Weâd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Dell Cameron securely at dell.3030 on Signal. If the motion is granted, OPM would be forced to disconnect the server until the assessment is done. As a consequence, the Trump administrationâs plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce would likely face delays. The email account linked to the serverâHR@opm.govâis currently being used to gather information from federal workers accepting buyouts under the adminâs âdeferred resignation program,â which is set to expire on February 6. âUnder the law, a temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy,â notes National Security Counselorsâ executive director, Kel McClanahan. âBut this is an extraordinary situation.â Before issuing a restraining order, courts apply whatâs known as the âbalance of equitiesâ doctrine, weighing the burdens and costs on both parties. In this case, however, McClanahan argues that the injunction would inflict âno hardshipâ on the government whatsoever. February 6 is an âarbitrary deadline,â he says, and the administration could simply continue to implement the resignation program âthrough preexisting channels.â âWe can't wait for the normal course of litigation when all that information is just sitting there in some system nobody knows about with who knows what protections,â McClanahan says. âIn a normal case, we might be able to at least count on the inspector general to do something, but Trump fired her, so all bets are off.â The motion further questions whether OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits federal agencies from taking actions ânot in accordance with the law.â Under the APA, courts may âcompel agency actionââsuch as a private assessmentâwhen it is âunlawfully withheld.â Employees at various agencies were reportedly notified last month to be on the lookout for messages originating from the  HR@opm.gov  account. McClanahanâs complaint points to a January 23 email from acting Homeland Security secretary Benjamine Huffman instructing DHS employees that the HR@opm.gov account âcan be considered trusted.â In the following days, emails were blasted out twice across the executive branch instructing federal workers to reply âYesâ in both cases. The same account was later used to transmit the âFork in the Roadâ missive promoting the Trump administrationâs legally dubious âdeferred resignation program,â which claims to offer federal workers the opportunity to quit but continue receiving paychecks through September. Workers who wished to participate in the program were instructed to reply to the email with âResign.â As WIRED  has reported , even the new HR chief of DOGE, Muskâs task force, was unable to answer basic questions about the offer. The legal authority underlying the program is unclear, and federal employee union leaders are warning workers not to blindly assume they will actually get paid. In a floor speech last week, Senator Tim Kaine  advised workers  not to be fooled: âThereâs no budget line item to pay people who are not showing up for work.â Patty Murray, ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, similarly warned Monday: âThere is no funding allocated to agencies to pay staff for this offer.â McClanahanâs lawsuit highlights the governmentâs response to the OPM hack of 2015, which compromised personnel records on more than 22 million people, including some whoâd undergone background checks to obtain security clearances. A  congressional report  authored by House Republicans following the breach pinned the incident on a âbreakdown in communicationsâ between OPMâs chief information officer and its inspector general: âThe future effectiveness of the agencyâs information technology and security efforts,â it says, âwill depend on a strong relationship between these two entities moving forward.â OPMâs inspector general, Krista Boyd, was fired by President Donald Trump in the midst of the â Friday night purge â on January 24âone day after the first HR@opm.gov email was sent. âWe are witnessing an unprecedented exfiltration and seizure of the most sensitive kinds of information by unelected, unvetted people with no experience, responsibility, or right to it,â says Sean Vitka, policy director at the Demand Progress Education Fund, which is supporting the action. âMillions of Americans and the collective interests of the United States desperately need emergency intervention from the courts. The constitutional crisis is already here.â",

    "body": "The US governmentâs primary agency for distributing foreign aid, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), announced Tuesday that the majority of its staff will stop working and begin the process of returning home by the end of the week. In an internal email viewed by WIRED that was  later reposted  on the USAID website, the agency said that âall USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functionsâ on Friday, February 7. The email noted that USAID âwould arrange and pay for return travel to the United States within 30 daysâ for overseas workers, and that it would consider travel extensions on a case-by-case basis. Elon Musk, who has been tasked with running President Donald Trump's new  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) group , has spent the last week attempting to dismantle USAID, which he has called a â a criminal organization .\" Before the email was sent on Tuesday,  some USAID employeesâ email and systems access had been abruptly cut off, making it harder to get official information about what might happen next. âEverybody is rightfully very concerned for our overseas staff that are essentially just being left stranded,â a current USAID employee in the US told WIRED. âWe're not sure how we're going to get them home safe.â WIRED has seen internal information showing that USAID leadership attempted to compile a list of overseas employees worldwide on Monday. On Tuesday, Pete Marocco, the State Departmentâs newly appointed foreign assistance director  tapped to oversee  USAID, convened with senior State Department leaders and  instructed them  to bring all overseas employees back to the US, according to CBS News. The news outlet also reported that Marocco said he would evacuate staff with support from the US military if necessary. On Tuesday afternoon, USAID employees still connected to their email accounts received notice that the agencyâs Washington, DC, headquarters would remain closed for the remainder of the week, according to a copy of the message reviewed by WIRED. Some received a memo from Marocco indicating that they had been placed on administrative leave âuntil otherwise notified.â USAID did not respond to requests for comment. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment. About  10,000 people  work for USAID, roughly two-thirds of whom are stationed overseas, according to the US Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan policy research group that serves Congress (the figure excludes âinstitutional supportâ contractors). The agency has more than 60 regional and country missions and represents less than 1 percent of the total US federal budget overall. Got a Tip?

His administration later clarified that programs carrying out lifesaving work such as providing medical and food assistance could receive humanitarian waivers to continue, but a number of organizations around the world say that the process has been mired in confusion and chaos. Even vital HIV and AIDS prevention work  has been stymied , WIRED reported Monday. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took acting control of USAID on Monday, speculated that if aid organizations had any misunderstandings, that was a reflection of their incompetence. âIf some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization,â Rubio said. He added that perhaps some groups were âdeliberately sabotaging\" the process to make âa political point.â When he was a US senator, Rubio repeatedly voiced support for some US foreign aid programs. âForeign aid is not charity,â he  said on social media  in 2017. âWe must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.â In 2019, Rubio  said he was working on  âgetting Congressional support for a multilateral humanitarian aid plan so we can get food & medicine to the suffering people of Venezuela.â (Florida, where Rubio is from, is home to a large Venezuelan population.) Overall, USAID provided assistance to roughly 130 countries in 2023. The top recipients of aid were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Syria, according to the Congressional Research Service. The dismantling of USAID is part of a broader âAmerica Firstâ agenda promoted by the new Trump administration that involves pulling back from a number of international organizations and diplomatic efforts. On Tuesday, President Trump signed an executive order  withdrawing  the US from the UNâs Human Rights Council. Update 2/4/25 9:36 PM EST: This story has been updated to reflect that all direct hire USAID personnel have been placed on administrative leave.",

    "body": "Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, publicly at least, are on good terms. Yet when it comes to the staff in and around the new administration, itâs a different story. Just two-and-a-half weeks into Trumpâs second term in office, a fissure has begun to emerge following  Muskâs DOGE takeover  of the US government, according to a half-dozen  Trump loyalist  Republican aides and advisers inside and around the administration who spoke with WIRED. âI think itâs more the staff who have an issue with Elon than President Trump,â a Republican aide familiar with the discussions around DOGE and the administration tells WIRED. This staffer, like others, requested anonymity to relay sensitive conversations due to fears of retaliation. In the space of a couple of weeks, Elon Musk and his associates have taken control of  multiple government agencies , and  a cadre of young and inexperienced engineers  with ties to Musk have been given access to some of the most  highly sensitive federal systems through DOGE.  As Muskâs associates tore through the federal apparatus over the first weekend of February, a ride-or-die MAGA Republican operative who knows President Trump personally confided something to WIRED they never thought theyâd find themselves saying before the past two weeks. âThere could be a collision course coming here at some point,â they said when asked if thereâs a brewing freak-out over Musk in Trumpworld. âHeâs getting too big for his breeches.â The motivations of the people WIRED has spoken with cover a wide range. Some Trump campaign veterans hope White House chief of staff Susie Wiles will intervene, while other Republican operatives think the emerging rift is a problem despite having no personal animosity toward Musk. Others stand to gain personally or professionally from a Musk ouster. Beyond increasing frustration over Musk causing headaches for the administrationâwhich many of these Republicans consider to be more optics issues than full-blown policy disastersâthe Republicans who spoke to WIRED had little to no idea what the proper chain of communication is supposed to be between agencies and the White House. On Tuesday, Trump went on Fox News to declare that the new DOGE staffers were actually working in the White House, even though he said he hasnât seen them. Minutes prior, a senior White House official told WIRED that âDOGE is part of the White Houseâ now. (Confusingly, Trump established DOGE by  repurposing  the existing US Digital Service as the US DOGE Service, an agency under the Office of Management and Budget, via executive order.) The Trump White House official said DOGE checks in with them âevery day.â Yet when asked about the nature of these briefings and if they could offer any specifics as to whether they take place on a schedule or with early morning priority, a common practice for those tasked with liaising between agencies and the White House, they had none. The DOGE briefings are âas needed,â the senior White House official said. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee at the Treasury or Bureau of the Fiscal Service? Or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Leak2Lahut.26. What distinguishes this staff-level discontent from the grumblings during the transition about Muskâs proximity to and  influence over Trump at Mar-a-Lago  is that actual policy decisions are being madeâso many and so fast that it's hard for even the president's most loyal foot soldiers to keep track. While the staffâs qualms with Musk are rather straightforward, nobody seems to know how to handle the high-velocity and high-volume nature of the DOGE government takeover. âListen, when the process is going this fast, from extreme outsiders, the communication is bound to be a mess,â says Matthew Bartlett, a Republican operative and former State Department official under Trump in his first term. Bartlett says the rest of Washington is getting their first real taste of the Silicon Valleyâinfluenced attitudes driving much of the private sector, now in the form of twentysomethings from DOGE appearing on government calls. âI mean, listen, this goes to the old adage of Steve Jobs â¦ finding you in the elevator and saying, give me 10 seconds to tell me what you do, and justify your job,â Bartlett claims. âThat is legendary stuff in the private sectorâand maybe it workedâbut, there are so many nuances to government that it makes addressing and making wide, sweeping changes highly problematic.â Republicans who landed administration jobs arenât exactly shocked a possible rift is emerging. âCan't say a lot of that surprises me to hear,â an administration source familiar with the discussions tells WIRED. Sources say many people have turned to Wiles as one of the only people who could even attempt to reign in Musk. âSome of it is, sheâs gotta balance being the gatekeeper to the president and having Musk kinda going rogue on a lot of this stuff,â says the second Republican operative familiar with the discussions. âI think sheâs very smart and very talented, and very loyal to President Trump, so sheâll think about how to navigate that best.â That, of course, depends heavily on her bossâs desire for any sort of gatekeeping or insulation from the possible looming Musk implosion many of these Republicans are bracing for. âIâm just hearing the president is entirely enthusiastic about his efforts, and they are working together very closely,â a source close to Trump who speaks with the president regularly told WIRED. âAnd that comes from someone at the very top. Not him, but someone under him.â Without any tacit approval to step out in front of the boss, the staff are left with no other viable options to express their reservations about how Musk has been operating. Trumpâs own awareness of what DOGE is up to appeared to be in question after his Oval Office news conference on Tuesday. Shortly after he suggested that the federal government should deploy the young DOGE staffers as air traffic controllersââWe should use some of them in the control towers, where we were putting people that were actually intellectually deficient,â the president saidâthe same senior White House official quickly dismissed the comment as a serious proposal. âLmfao no,â the White House official told WIRED in a text message. âYou guys need to learn how to cover him. He was making the point that smart bright people need to be ATCâs [sic.].â Trump simultaneously suggested the DOGE staffers are young and âvery smart,â but also that âsome are young, and some are not young. Some are not young at all.â He has  also insisted  everything is fine around Muskâs role in the administration, and that the billionaire â can't do and won't do â anything âwithout our approval.â Several Republicans in and around the Trump administration declined to speak on the record about Musk, with one GOP operative summarizing the dynamic as too hot to touch. âOff the recordâyeah, Iâve heard about some of this. But, look, as of now, Iâm gonna keep out of the space between the worldâs richest man and the worldâs most powerful man,â a Republican operative in Trumpworld told WIRED in an encrypted message, followed by a smiley face emoji. (This Republican later agreed to let WIRED use this quote under the condition of anonymity.) âI have to believe a lot of this is a performance by people who are worried about getting fired,â a Trump adviser said of the staffâs patience wearing thin with the worldâs richest man. The dynamic between Trumpâs loyal aides and Musk, already riddled with varying degrees of mistrust over Musk bringing in his own people, is made all the more complicated by the X ownerâs relationship with Florida governor Ron DeSantisâ entourage. Muskâs ongoing work with the firm Pathway Public P2 Affairs, which is staffed by several alumni of the DeSantis campaign, continues to irk MAGA loyalists who thought DeSantisâ allies would be frozen out of the consulting space after Trumpâs victory. Now, theyâre in âthese positions of influence â¦ especially with Musk,â says the second Republican operative. This is a particularly fraught dynamic when it comes to Wiles, who was  iced out by DeSantis  after she helped him become governor of Florida. âThereâs concern about Musk and others being involved with people who went to the mat for Ron DeSantis and spent hundreds of millions of dollars against Donald Trump,â they later added, after claiming the collision course with Musk could happen sooner than expected. There were also several Trump advisers  ready to go on the record to publicly bash Musk  for what they considered to be his bungled get-out-the-vote effort through America PAC after the general election, should Trump have lost. WIRED reported extensively on the working conditions of door knockers for contractors for America PAC, including a group of canvassers in Michigan who were  driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul moving van  and threatened to have their pay and lodging withheld if they did not hit their quotas for Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor for Muskâs PAC. âOperatives that really know whatâs going on, people want an audit of America PAC for the sake of America First,â a Republican operative tells WIRED. Some of these Republicans, it seems, want a DOGE for Muskâs outside political operation. âThe point is, who is auditing?â says the second Trumpworld operative. Whatâs most notable about these Republicans reaching the limit of their patience with Musk is that for the most part, they were pretty big fans until recent weeks. âI think people have been very annoyed by it,â said the Republican who wants an audit of America PAC. âAnd I mean, look, I think Elon's really important. Everyone's grateful. It's just sort of an unnecessary situation.â",

    "body": "An engineer named Nikhil Rajpal is representing Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), according to multiple sources. Government records reviewed by WIRED show that Rajpal has working email addresses with both DOGE and the NOAA. The  DOGE  address, like others from the agency, is in a format tying it to the Executive Office of the President. Rajpal also appears in the NOAAâs public-facing employee directory. According to sources familiar with the situation, on Wednesday, NOAA employees were ordered to grant Rajpal editor access to all NOAA Google sites on instructions of the acting commerce secretary, Jeremy Pelter, by the close of business. An NOAA employee with more than 40 years of service who led the agencyâs work on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility was, according to these sources, placed on administrative leave Tuesday, three weeks ahead of their scheduled retirement. This person did not respond to a request for comment. Axios reported  on Tuesday that DOGE workers entered NOAA facilities in Maryland on Tuesday seeking âaccess to IT systems.â A source WIRED spoke to confirmed this. While Rajpalâs online presence appears to have been recently largely wiped, WIRED was able to obtain copies of rÃ©sumÃ©s and, through public databases, other biographical information. They show Nik, as he refers to himself, to be about 30 and to have studied computer science and history at UC Berkeley. Rajpal worked at Twitter before Elon Muskâs acquisition, and prior to that did work redesigning a Tesla console. As an undergraduate, Rajpal was the leader of a libertarian-aligned  student group  advocating for âminimal government, free markets, sound money, non-intervention, and maximum individual liberty.â In 2014 he gave a 10-minute presentation on bitcoin to Viget, the company at which he was interning. An  Instapaper account  linked from his personal site under the header âRead the articles I readâ shows articles from Richard Hanania, Quillette, and  Zero Hedge , as well as publications like the Financial Times and Bloomberg. Nothing in his background suggests any special expertise relevant to his new role. The NOAA is a nonpartisan scientific agency that monitors and models the oceans and atmosphere for the purpose of predicting changes in climate and weather; its research and technology underlie everything from weather reports to hurricane modeling and fisheries management to granular forecasts of the long-term effects of climate change. The agency has long been a target of conservatives; the  Project 2025  policy tome calls for it to be broken up and downsized, and for the work of the National Weather Serviceâwhich sits within NOAAâto be largely privatized. Got a Tip? Are you a current employee of the NOAA, or otherwise have insight into how DOGE is operating within the government? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact timmarchman.01. Rajpal did not immediately reply to a request for comment. NOAA directed a request to the Department of Commerce, under which it sits. Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. DOGE workers, according to WIREDâs sources and published reports, have effectively taken over key government agencies including the  Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) and the  General Services Administration  (GSA) Theyâve also  played a key role  in blocking HIV and AIDS relief that the administration exempted from foreign aid cuts from reaching recipients as part of Musk and President Donald Trumpâs purge of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Under the terms of an  executive order  signed by Trump, DOGE has access to all unclassified systems, giving its representatives an extraordinary range of power over sensitive government systems that, among other things, contain the personal information of tens of millions of citizens as well as information about businesses. One DOGE worker, as  WIRED has reported , has full access to the code of a Treasury Department system that controls the vast majority of the trillions of dollars in payments the federal government makes every year.",

    "body": "A number of federal employees at the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), the US federal agency that monitors and models the oceans and atmosphere for the purpose of predicting changes in climate and weather, have received orders to temporarily cease communicating with foreign nationals, including those working directly with the US government, WIRED has learned. An internal email obtained by WIRED shows that the NOAAâs National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received orders to pause âALL INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS.â (Emphasis theirs.) The message states that the orders extend to participation in international commissions and even emails âwith foreign national colleagues.â The email further instructs NMFS employeesâresponsible for promoting the conservation of sea life and sustainability of Americaâs seafood sourcesâto submit details of any ongoing work with international partners for vetting by higher-ups, including those at the US Department of Commerce, the NOAAâs umbrella agency. The NOAA and the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The motive behind the incommunicado orders is not immediately clear, nor is it clear how long they will last. According to a source with knowledge of NMFS operations, granted anonymity becauseâas with other sources in this storyâthey were not authorized to speak to the press, NOAA officials discussed in a meeting Wednesday feeling targeted by the Trump administration, saying their work faces âhuge exposureâ due to offshore wind projects and  participation  in international wind energy workshops, conferences, and summits. The agency had been anticipating, for example, hosting international fellows and interns this summer associated with an offshore wind development  working group  founded by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the world's oldest intergovernmental science organization. President Donald Trump issued an  executive order  on his first day in office designed to paralyze growth in wind energy. In a postinaugural speech,  he told rally-goers : âWe're not going to do the wind thing.â According to another source at the NOAA, the incommunicado orders extend to the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. In addition to gathering data from across the federal government, NESDIS relies on a wide range of international partners. NESDISâs weather and climate data is essential not only to air transportation safety but also to combat drought, monitor coral reef destruction, and safeguard railway shipping carriers against dangerous weather. According to NESDISâs  website , it works closely with the European Space Agency, which provides access to data via a collection of Sentinel satellites maintained by EUMETSAT, an international weather-monitoring agency composed of more than 30 member states. WIRED  reported Wednesday  that NOAA officials had been ordered to grant Nikhil Rajpal, a former Twitter employee who appears to have no expertise in ocean and atmospheric science, the power to edit documents concerning the agencyâs work hosted by Google Sites. The orders, sources said, came from acting commerce secretary Jeremy Pelter. Government records show Rajpal now has working email addresses with both the NOAA and Elon Muskâs Department of Government Efficient (DOGE) task force. WIRED has also learned that Rajpal is listed as an âexpertâ on a roster at the Office of Personnel Management, the governmentâs human resources department, where DOGE operatives have installed a server gathering information on federal employees that has been used to repeatedly communicate the administrationâs deferred resignation program. The NOAA has been a popular target of conservatives, many of whom have called for various of its functions to  either be dismantled or privatized .",

    "body": "A young technologist known online as âBig Balls,â who  works for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) , has access to sensitive US government systems. But his professional and online history call into question whether he would pass the background check typically required to obtain security clearances, security experts tell WIRED. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old high school graduate, established at least five different companies in the last four years, with entities registered in Connecticut, Delaware, and the United Kingdom, most of which were not listed on his now-deleted LinkedIn profile. Coristine also briefly worked in 2022 at Path Network, a network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers. Someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine also solicited a cyberattack-for-hire service later that year. Coristine did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One of the companies Coristine founded, Tesla.Sexy LLC, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old. Coristine is  listed as the founder and CEO of the company , according to business records reviewed by WIRED. Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains. One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review. \"Foreign connections, whether it's foreign contacts with friends or domain names registered in foreign countries, would be flagged by any agency during the security investigation process,\" Joseph Shelzi, a former US Army intelligence officer who held security clearance for a decade and managed the security clearance of other units under his command, tells WIRED. A longtime former US intelligence analyst, who requested anonymity to speak on sensitive topics, agrees. âThere's little chance that he could have passed a background check for privileged access to government systems,â they allege. Another domain under Coristineâs control is faster.pw. The website is currently inactive, but an  archived version  from October 25, 2022 shows content in Chinese that stated the service helped provide âmultiple encrypted cross-border networks.â Prior to joining DOGE, Coristine worked for several months of 2024 at Elon Muskâs Neuralink brain implant startup, and,  as WIRED previously reported , is now listed in Office of Personnel Management records as an âexpertâ at that agency, which oversees personnel matters for the federal government. Employees of the General Services Administration say he also joined calls where they were made to justify their jobs and to review code theyâve written. Other elements of Coristineâs personal record reviewed by WIRED, government security experts say, would also raise questions about obtaining security clearances necessary to access privileged government data. These same experts further wonder about the vetting process for DOGE staffâand, given Coristineâs history, whether he underwent any such background check. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about what level of clearance, if any, Corisitine has and, if so, how it was granted. At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn rÃ©sumÃ©. Path has at times listed as employees Eric Taylor,  also known as Cosmo the God , a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. Itâs unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company. âIf I was doing the background investigation on him, I would probably have recommended against hiring him for the work heâs doing,â says EJ Hilbert, a former FBI agent who also briefly served as the CEO of Path Network prior to Coristineâs employment there. âIâm not opposed to the idea of cleaning up the government. But I am questioning the people that are doing it.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former US government employee? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at Andy.01 (Andy Greenberg), DavidGilbert.01 (David Gilbert), or +1 (347) 722-1347 (Lily Hay Newman). Potential concerns about Coristine extend beyond his work history. Archived Telegram messages shared with WIRED show that, in November 2022, a person using the handle âJoeyCrafterâ posted to a Telegram channel focused on so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberattacks that bombard victim sites with junk traffic to knock them offline. In his messages, JoeyCrafterâwhich records from Discord, Telegram, and the networking protocol BGP indicate was a handle used by Coristineâwrites that heâs âlooking for a capable, powerful and reliable L7â that accepts bitcoin payments. That line, in the context of a DDoS-for-hire Telegram channel, suggests he was looking for someone who could carry out a layer-7 attack, a certain form of DDoS. A DDoS-for-hire service with the name Dstat.cc was seized in a multinational law enforcement operation last year. The JoeyCrafter Telegram account had previously used the name âRivage,â a name linked to Coristine on Discord and at Path, according to Path internal communications shared with WIRED. Both the Rivage Discord and Telegram accounts at times promoted Coristineâs DiamondCDN startup. Itâs not clear whether the JoeyCrafter message was followed by an actual DDoS attack. (In the internal messages among Path staff, a question is asked about Rivage, at which point an individual clarifies they are speaking about âEdward.â) \"It does depend on which government agency is sponsoring your security clearance request, but everything that you've just mentioned would absolutely raise red flags during the investigative process,\" says Shelzi, the former US Army intelligence officer. He adds that a secret security clearance could be completed in as little as 50 days, while a top-secret security clearance could take anywhere from 90 days to a year to complete. Coristineâs online history, including a LinkedIn account where he calls himself Big Balls, has disappeared recently. He also previously used an account on X with the username @edwardbigballer. The account had a bio that read: âTechnology. Arsenal. Golden State Warriors. Space Travel.â Prior to using the @edwardbigballer username, Coristine was linked to an account featuring the screen name âSteven Frenchâ featuring a picture of what appears to be Humpty Dumpty smoking a cigar. In multiple posts from 2020 and 2021, the account can be seen responding to posts from Musk. Coristineâs X account is currently set to private. Davi Ottenheimer, a longtime security operations and compliance manager, says many factors about Coristineâs employment history and online footprint could raise questions about his ability to obtain security clearance. âLimited real work experience is a risk,â says Ottenheimer, as an example. âPlus his handle is literally Big Balls.â",

    "body": "Members of Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) team have had access to the US Treasury Departmentâs payment systems for over a week. On Thursday, the threat intelligence team at one of the department's agencies recommended that  DOGE members  be monitored as an âinsider threat.â Sources say members of the Bureau of the Fiscal Serviceâs IT division and others received an email detailing these concerns. âThere is ongoing litigation, congressional legislation, and widespread protests relating to DOGEâs access to Treasury and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,â reads a section of the email titled âRecommendations,â reviewed by WIRED. âIf DOGE members have any access to payment systems, we recommend suspending that access immediately and conducting a comprehensive review of all actions they may have taken on these systems.â Although Treasury and White House officials have repeatedly denied it, WIRED has reported that DOGE technologists had the ability to not only read the code of sensitive payment systems but also rewrite it.  Marko Elez , one of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are associated with DOGE, was granted read and write privileges on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the  Payment Automation Manager  and  Secure Payment System  at the BFS, an agency that according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. âThere is reporting at other federal agencies indicating that DOGE members have performed unauthorized changes and locked civil servants out of the sensitive systems they gained access to,â the âRecommendationsâ portion of the email continues. âWe further recommend that DOGE members be placed under insider threat monitoring and alerting after their access to payment systems is revoked. Continued access to any payment systems by DOGE members, even âread only,â likely poses the single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.â The recommendations were part of a weekly report sent out by the BFS threat intelligence team to hundreds of staffers. âInsider threat risks are something [the threat intelligence team] usually covers,â a source told WIRED. âBut they have never identified something inside the bureau as an insider threat risk that I know of.â The Treasury Department and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee at the Treasury or Bureau of the Fiscal Service? Or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18 and leahfeiger.86. The email also details this weekâs  Treasury lawsuit , which resulted in a federal judge granting an order on February 6 to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and altering payment system information. In a section of the email titled âAnalyst Notes,â the email delves into the fallout from the suit. âA court order formalizing an agreement reportedly restricting DOGEâs access to Treasury was issued, but specifically provides âread onlyâ exemptions for Marko Elez (DOGE member at Fiscal Service and Treasury) and Thomas (aka Tom) Krause (DOGE member at Treasury),â it states. âThis access still poses an unprecedented insider threat risk.â Elez previously worked for SpaceX, Muskâs space company, and X, Muskâs social media company. Elez resigned Thursday after The Wall Street Journal  inquired  with the White House about his connections to âa deleted social-media account that advocated for racism and eugenics.â Elez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a letter to Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on February 7, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that âTreasuryâs refusal to provide straight answers about DOGEâs actions, as well as its refusal to provide a briefing requested by several Senate committees only heightens my suspicionsâ and requested that Bessent provide the logs of Elez and any other DOGE-affiliated personnel regarding their access to the Treasuryâs systems.",

    "body": "The Department of Government Efficiency has built a âfirewallâ separating  Elon Muskâs team  from the 200 or so legacy workers employed by what was previously called the  United States Digital Service  (USDS), sources tell WIRED. Since Musk's USDS takeover, sources claim, the original USDS staff has had very little contact with Muskâs team. A DOGE representative was expected to join several USDS meetings last week, but they did not show up. The only time legacy staff have met with recently installed personnel was a Friday  meeting with DOGEâs HR chief, Stephanie Holmes , which WIRED first reported. In that meeting, Holmes was unable to provide many answers to a slew of questions related to the deferred resignations program offered to most federal employees. âThem not showing up shows that they clearly do not give a fuck about us,â one source told WIRED. âItâs the biggest âfuck youâ because we wait for them to come and they donât.â Without new directives, USDS sources tell WIRED theyâve been operating as if things are âbusiness as usual,â continuing work on long-term projects that have carried over from President Joe Bidenâs administration. âThey donât talk to us,â one USDS employee tells WIRED. âAs far as I can tell, theyâre hiding,â says another. The Musk teamâs aloofness underscores the secrecy surrounding DOGE staff. Last week,  WIRED reported that unnamed, young engineers  were tasked with interviewing staff at USDS and the General Services Administration and at times reviewing code. âWe're afraid of those folks' names getting out and their personal lives being disrupted, which is exactly what happened last week, which is really unfortunate for them,â Thomas Shedd, director of GSAâs Technology Transformation Service,  said in a meeting with staff on Monday . Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Former USDS deputy administrator Ted Carstensen, the highest-ranking USDS official outside of Muskâs orbit,  resigned on Thursday . He repeatedly invited members of Muskâs team, including DOGE senior adviser Steve Davis, to join staff meetings, sources tell WIRED, but they never showed. Two sources said that Carstensen was repeatedly left out of leadership meetings and felt kept out of the loop on decisionmaking. Carstensen was supposed to meet with Holmes on Wednesday, a source said, but the meeting was canceled last minute. In a resignation email viewed by WIRED, Carstensen confirmed that Thursday would be his final day. He said that he would not be taking the deferred resignation offer that has colloquially been called âthe forkâ after the  Fork in the Road email  federal workers received last week offering them continued pay and benefits through September 30. âThis was not an easy decision for me to make as my time at the US Digital Service has been one of the best periods in my career. I believe wholeheartedly in the mission and have been inspired every day by the commitment, kindness, and intelligence of the team,â Carstensen wrote. âIt was important for me to get the team to a place where everyone could choose their own path forward, which is where we find ourselves today. I hope each of you lands on the path thatâs best for you, and I look forward to staying in touch and seeing where it takes you.â Carstensen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carstensenâs decision to refuse the âforkâ deal echoes a similar sentiment held among the broader USDS staff. âThereâs a strong feeling within USDS that people donât want to take the fork because they donât want to send the message that they're somehow accepting or approving of the larger plan,â a USDS source said. In an internal meeting following Carstensenâs departure, staff were told that he would not be replaced and that his responsibilities would be spread across the rest of the organization, a source said. Within the meeting, staff members lamented the state of the organization, fearing Carstensenâs departure showed that Musk and his team were in full control. âIt's almost indisputable that USDS is in the endgame,â one person in the meeting said. âTime to start loading into the life boats,â said another.",

    "body": "Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency  staffers are set to gain access to data at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, multiple sources tell WIRED. In an email early Friday morning, CFPB staff were told that several people from  DOGE âincluding Nikhil Rajpal and Gavin Kliger (along with Chris Young, who has been described as a Republican political adviser connected with Elon Musk)âentered the agency building Thursday evening. The email stated that they would require access to CFPB data, systems, and equipment, following a message sent Thursday by CFPB chief operating officer Adam Martinez confirming that the DOGE employees were to receive â read-only â access. âDOGE arrived tonight and will be back tomorrow. They are going to need read-only access to our HR (HR Connect/NFC), procurement (PRISM), and finance (Discoverer) system,â said Martinez. âI let them know that we utilize BFS/ARC so if they already have access, then they should be able to pull our data. Otherwise, if they do not have access to BFS/ARC, then we will need to work with them to fill out the necessary forms to gain access.â BFS/ARC is the Bureau of the Fiscal Serviceâs Administrative Resource Center, which provides administrative services, like timekeeping travel days or benefits, for a number of government agencies. The CFPB was authorized by the Dodd-Frank act in the aftermath of predatory and deceptive behaviors in the banking sector that led to the 2008 financial crisis. The independent agency has the directive to investigate and reform these financial institutions. The CFPB systems DOGE staffers will have access to contain information related to CFPB staff, like performance reviews, salary, and benefits information, a source tells WIRED. DOGE staff has also sought to gain access to procurement and financial data at other agencies. Over the past week, WIRED has reported that Muskâs DOGE team has gained access to a variety of government systems and infrastructure, including the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and  a sensitive payment system housed within the Treasury Department . âAll three will receive CFPB laptops and they will also have PIV cards so they are authorized to gain access as though they were a detailee assigned to us or one of our own employees. Again, they are only looking for read-only access,â the CFPB email said. A PIV card is a government-issued personal identity verification. Got a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Read-only access only allows for people to view a system, whereas âwriteâ access allows them to view and modify that systemâs data. DOGE could use the information contained in the requested systems to inform decisions about reductions in the CFPBâs workforce and spending, sources tell WIRED. Another source confirmed that the DOGE members now show up in the CFPBâs internal directory. âThe unelected Musk recently announced plans for a new payments platform run jointly by Visa and 'Xâ (formerly Twitter),â a press release issued by the CFPBâs union said Friday morning. âNow, heâs moved his power grab to the CFPB, in a clear attempt to attack union workers and defang the only agency that checks the greed of payment providers, as well as auto lenders like Tesla.â âCFPB Union members welcome our newest colleagues and look forward to the smell of Axe Body Spray in our elevators,â the union press release continued.",

    "body": "US Treasury Department and White House officials have repeatedly denied that technologists associated with Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) had the ability to rewrite the code of the payment system through which the vast majority of federal spending flows. WIRED reporting shows, however, that at the time these statements were made, a DOGE operative did in fact have write access. Not only that, but sources tell WIRED that at least one note was added to Treasury records indicating that he no longer had write access before senior IT staff stated it was actually rescinded. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old DOGE technologist, was recently installed at the Treasury Department as a special government employee. One of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are currently associated with DOGE, Elez previously worked for SpaceX, Muskâs space company, and X, Muskâs social media company. Elez resigned Thursday after The Wall Street Journal  inquired  about his connections to âa deleted social-media account that advocated for racism and eugenics.â As WIRED  has reported , Elez was granted privileges including the ability to not just read but write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the  Payment Automation Manager  (PAM) and  Secure Payment System  (SPS) at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), an agency that according to Treasury records paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. Reporting from  Talking Points Memo  confirmed that Treasury employees were concerned that Elez had already made âextensive changesâ to code within the Treasury system. The payments processed by BFS include federal tax returns, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and veteranâs pay. Over the last week, the nuts and bolts of DOGEâs access to the Treasury has been at the center of an escalating crisis. On January 31, David Lebryk, the most senior career civil servant in the Treasury, announced he would retire; he had been placed on administrative leave after refusing to give Muskâs DOGE team access to the federal payment system. The next morning, sources tell WIRED, Elez was granted read and write access to PAM and SPS. On February 3,  Politico reported  that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Republican lawmakers in the House Financial Services Committee that Musk and DOGE didnât have control over key Treasury systems. The same day,  The New York Times reported  that Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that DOGEâs access was âread-only.â Got a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18, dmehro.89, leahfeiger.86, and timmarchman.01. The significance of this is that the ability to alter the code on these systems would in theory give a DOGE technologistâand, by extension, Musk, President Donald Trump, or other actorsâthe capability to, among other things, illegally cut off Congressionally authorized payments to specific individuals or entities. (CNN  reported  on Thursday that Musk associates had demanded that Treasury pause authorized payments to USAID, precipitating Lebrykâs resignation.) On February 4, WIRED reported that Elez did, in fact, have admin access to PAM and SPS. Talking Points Memo  reported  later that day that Elez had âmade extensive changes to the code base for these critical payment systems.â In a  letter  that same day that did not mention Musk or DOGE, Treasury official Jonathan Blum wrote to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, âCurrently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee, will have read-only to the coded data of the Fiscal Serviceâs payment systems.â (Krause is the top DOGE operative at Treasury and CEO of Cloud Software Group.) The letter did not say what kind of access the staff members actually had. Sources tell WIRED that by afternoon of the next day, February 5, Elezâs access had been changed to âread-onlyâ from both read and code-writing privileges. That same day, a federal judge granted an order to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and changing Treasury payment system information, following a lawsuit alleging the Treasury Department provided âElon Musk or other individuals associated with DOGEâ with access to the payment systems, and that this access violated federal privacy laws. The  order  specifically provided a carve-out for two individuals: Krause and Elez. At a court hearing later that day, Department of Justice lawyer Bradley Humphreys  asserte d that the order said their access would be âread-only.â âItâs a distinction without a difference,â a source told WIRED. Referring specifically to the PAM, through which $4.7 trillion flowed in fiscal year 2024, they said Elez should not have had âaccess to this almost $5 trillion payment flow, even if itâs âread-only.â None of this should be happening.â The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. âPeople will be held accountable for the crimes theyâre committing in this coup attempt,â Wyden tells WIRED. âIâm not letting up on my investigation of what these Musk hatchet men are up to.â",

    "body": "Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) has gutted the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), taking a team of  over 10,000  down to just under 300, according to an internal email viewed by WIRED and several current USAID employees. The move leaves only 12 people in the agencyâs Africa bureau and eight people in its Asia bureau, with around 290 overall. There will be some additional foreign workers retained, two USAID employees tell WIRED, but it is unclear how many. âThere are more impoverished people in Asia than anywhere else, and our presence has always helped counter the influence of China,â says one USAID employee, who was granted anonymity due to fears of retaliation and because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency. On Tuesday, USAID workers  received an email  noting that all personnel would be put on an administrative leave starting Friday, February 7, with the exception of âdesignated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions.â The notice was published on the agencyâs website shortly thereafter. It also specified that the agencyâs workers stationed abroad would be recalled back to the United States. USAID and the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This was not an unexpected move. USAID has been a special target in Muskâs crosshairs, with the centibillionaire  calling it  a âcriminal organizationâ on X and  boasting  about âfeeding it through a wood chipper.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at Kateknibbs.09. President Donald Trump has been similarly hostile to the agency. One of his first actions after taking office last month was to sign an executive order to freeze foreign aid, much of which is implemented by USAID. Already, the change has stymied anti-human-trafficking work, including projects that help people escape from labor compounds where they are enslaved and forced to commit digital fraud, WIRED  reported  on Wednesday. Although the administration subsequently clarified that âlifesavingâ work would be allowed to continue under an emergency waiver program, the chaotic takeover of the agency has made this impossible in practice. As WIRED  reported  on Monday, vital HIV/AIDS work has been disrupted, with workers on the ground in countries like Haiti unable to access antiretroviral medicationsâeven though much of that work was technically granted a waiver. Meanwhile, some current employees stationed abroad have yet to be informed of the agencyâs latest changes. âThe only official communication Iâve received is from the local embassy State Department facilities people, asking if or when we were moving out so they could renovate our houses,â says one USAID worker stationed overseas.",

    "body": "The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) told federal lawmakers on Friday that  Elon Musk  and his  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) have seized control of a number of federal computer systems that house data tightly restricted under federal statutes. In some cases, any deviations in the manner in which the data is being used may be not only illegal, the ACLU says, but unconstitutional. DOGE operatives have infiltrated or assumed control of a number of federal agencies that are responsible for managing personnel files on nearly 2 million federal employees, as well as offices that supply the government with a broad range of software and information technology services. Unauthorized use of sensitive or personally identifiable data as part of an effort to purge the government of ideologically unaligned staff may constitute a  violation of federal law . The  Privacy Act  and the  Federal Information Security Modernization Act  strictly prohibit, for instance, unauthorized access and use of government personnel data. In a letter to members of several congressional oversight committees, ACLU attorneys highlighted DOGEâs access to Treasury systems that handle a âmajorityâ of federal payments, which includes details on Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and salaries. Citing WIRED  reporting from Tuesday , the attorneys note that, in addition to choking off funding to specific agencies or individuals, this grants DOGE access to âtroves of personal information,â including âmillions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances, and personal finances.â The attorneys write: âAccess toâand abuse ofâthat information could harm millions of people. Young engineers, with no experience in human resources, governmental benefits, or legal requirements around privacy have gained unprecedented surveillance over payments to federal employees, Social Security recipients, and small businessesâand with it, control over those payments.â The ACLU attorneys stress that, under normal circumstances, these systems would fall under the control of career civil servants with years of training and experience in managing sensitive data, all of whom survived a comprehensive vetting process. The group has also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the communications records of identified DOGE personnel, as well as for details of any requests the task force may have made for access to sensitive and personal data at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Other files the ACLU seeks pertain to DOGEâs plans to deploy artificial intelligence tools across the government, as well as any plans or discussions about how the task force plans to conform to the litany of federal laws safeguarding sensitive financial and medical information, such as the the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). WIRED  first reported Thursday  that DOGE operatives at the General Services Administration, which manages the US governmentâs IT infrastructure, had begun pushing to rapidly deploy a homebrew AI chatbot called âGSAi.â A source with knowledge of GSA's prior dealings with AI tells WIRED that the agency launched a pilot program last fall aimed at testing the use of Gemini, a chatbot adapted for Google Workplace. DOGE quickly determined, however, that Gemini would not provide the level of data desired by the task force. It's unclear whether GSA has assessed the privacy impacts of deploying the GSAi chatbotâa requirement under federal law. The ACLU tells WIRED it is prepared to pursue all options in obtaining the documents, including lawsuits, if necessary. âThe American people deserve to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized,â says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of ACLUâs Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. âThereâs every indication that DOGE has forced its way into the governmentâs most tightly protected databases and systems, without consideration of long-standing privacy safeguards mandated by Congress. We need answers now.â The ACLUâs warning was directed at the chairs and ranking members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Financial Services, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance. âPresidential overreach that violates our privacy and attacks funding for critical programs is going to hurt people across the countryâpotentially undermining Social Security, payments to small businesses, and programs that support children and families,â Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at ACLU, tells WIRED. âCongress must meet its constitutional responsibility and ensure that the president is carrying out the law, not flouting it.â",

    "body": "The establishment of Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  ( DOGE ) relied on a recruitment campaign carried out, in part, by young software engineers fanning out across online chat groups and Discord servers, according to three sources and chat logs reviewed by WIRED. Some of the engineers are associated with data analytics firm Palantir or its cofounder and board of directors chairâand Musk allyâPeter Thiel. As DOGE staffersâmany of them  young and with little or no government experience âcontinue to gain access to sensitive data across about a dozen government agencies, this is the first look at some of the networks from which the agency has recruited, and who they relied on to enlist talent. In online chat groups linked to Palantir alumni and SpaceX interns, Muskâs space company, as well as in a Discord server associated with a military artificial intelligence program, the engineers said they were looking for people willing to spend six months in Washington, DC, cutting federal spendingâwhich accounts for around a quarter of the US gross domestic productâby a third. Anthony Jancso, one of three engineers associated with the recruitment effort, is a former Palantir employee. According to sources, Jancso said he was recruited to DOGE by Steve Davis, the Boring Company president and Musk lieutenant whom Bloomberg  reported  in December was leading recruitment for DOGE. Palantir, Jancso, and Davis did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jancsoâs rÃ©sumÃ© lists him as a 2021 graduate of University College London and as having been a âforward deployedâ software engineer at Palantir between December 2021 and May 2023. Jancso is best known for leading a project called Accelerate SF, which aims to leverage AI in the public sector. In a 2023 story about a then upcoming hackathon,  VentureBeat  reported that Accelerate had received support from companies including OpenAI and Anthropic. In 2024, the venture  became  known as AccelerateX. Purporting to offer âa modern OS for government,â AccelerateX  claims  it âtransforms government infrastructure with AI-powered automation and software, delivered in days.â On November 26, 2024, in a message reviewed by WIRED, a person using a screen name including the name Anthony and the same handle that Jancso uses on his X account posted in a Discord server associated with the  Space Force Generative AI Challenge âan âeight-week combination of AI crash course and problem-solving hack-a-thon that engaged 350-plus participants,â according to its website. âHelping the Dept. of Government Efficiency team find hardcore engineers,â the message reads. âSend your GitHub/LinkedIn to @DOGE on X and your X handle to me in DM if youâre interested or know someone who is, could help get them into the pipeline.â In early December, in another message reviewed by WIRED, a person using the same handle posted to a chat group for Palantir alumni. âHey all,â the message read. âIâm helping Elonâs team find tech talent for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the new admin. This is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3. If youâre interested in playing a role in this mission, please reach out in the next few days.â A person using the handle George Cooper followed on. âSimilar to Anthonyâs post,â the message read, âIâm also looking to refer people to DOGE. Efficiency will always be an exceptionally hard, complex problem and I personally believe we need the brightest people in the world to wrestle with that problem. Iâve always found Palantirians & ex-Palantirians to be the most exceptional people I know, so who better to confront that challenge. Shoot me a DM (or @Anthony ofc) if youâre interested.â (Reaction to these messages was, a source tells WIRED, âmixed.â) According to an online rÃ©sumÃ©, George Cooper graduated from Lehigh University in 2019 and has been employed at Palantir as a âforward deployedâ engineer since May 2024, following another stint at the company in a similar role from 2019 to 2023. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Itâs unclear what role, if any, Jancso currently has within DOGE. But one of Accelerate SFâs cofounders, as reported by VentureBeat, is former Waymo software engineer Jordan Wick, who completed undergrad at MIT in 2019 and earned a masters from the school the following year. Wick, according to government records reviewed by WIRED, appears to have a DOGE email account associated with the Executive Office of the President. Two sources tell WIRED that Wick is among the team that has been  given access to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  systems and equipment. Wick did not immediately respond to a request from WIRED. Shortly after the email was sent, his online rÃ©sumÃ© was removed. On December 5, 2024, around the same time the messages associated with Jancsoâs handle were being sent out, a person using the handle Luke Farritor posted a message in a Discord server for SpaceX interns. âHi everyone! Iâm recruiting SWEs for Doge. Reach out if interested!â the message reads. âWe are looking for skilled software engineers (and ops people) at any career stage who are willing to work for ~6mo in person in DC. Paid. Tons of really ambitious projects in the works. We are going to fix the government!â The six-month timeline aligns with the 130-workday limit that special government employees (SGEs) are legally allowed to serve in a single year. Musk himself is currently categorized as an SGE. Luke Farritor, as WIRED  first reported , is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern and Thiel Fellow now working as a DOGE technologist. Politico has  reported  that he is now listed as an information engineer in an internal directory at the Department of Energy. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since its establishment by executive order on the first day of Donald Trumpâs presidency, DOGE has taken over key agencies at the center of the federal government, such as the  Office of Personnel Management  and the  General Services Administration , and placed operatives in  about a dozen agencies  with the apparent aim of radically reducing the size of the federal workforce and increasing presidential powers. Its access to sensitive data and systems has placed DOGE at the center of a growing number of legal battles. Early Saturday morning, a federal judge temporarily  barred  members of the task force from access to records and the  Treasury payment system  through which the vast majority of federal spending flows, and ordered records in their possession destroyed immediately. As WIRED has  reported , a threat intelligence team at the agency recommended members have access to payment systems revoked and that they be monitored as an âinsider threat.â",

    "body": "This story originally  appeared on  Grist  and is part of the  Climate Desk  collaboration. As part of a broad effort to bypass Congress and unilaterally cut government spending, Donald Trumpâs administration has all but shut down operations at the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, the independent federal body that delivers humanitarian aid and economic development funding around the world. On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order pausing all USAID funding, and the agency subsequently issued a stop-work order to nearly all funding recipients, from soup kitchens in Sudan to the global humanitarian group Mercy Corps. Since then, Elon Muskâs new Department of Government Efficiency has shut down the agencyâs website, locked employees out of their email accounts, and closed the agencyâs Washington office. âUSAID is a criminal organization,â Musk posted on X on Sunday. âTime for it to die.â (The agency is codified in federal law, and court challenges are likely to argue that Muskâs actions are themselves illegal.) While criticisms of Trumpâs abrupt demolition of USAID have largely focused on global public health projects that have long enjoyed bipartisan support, the effort also threatens billions of dollars meant to combat climate change. USAIDâs climate-related funding helps low-income countries build renewable energy and adapt to worsening natural disasters, as well as conserve carbon sinks and sensitive ecosystems. During Joe Bidenâs administration, USAID accelerated its climate-focused efforts as part of an  ambitious new initiative  that was supposed to last through the end of the decade. That effort now appears to have come to an abrupt end as USAID contractors around the world prepare to  abandon critical projects and lay off staff . Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has taken over USAID as acting director, has said that Muskâs abrupt shutdown is ânot about getting rid of foreign aid.â But even if USAID eventually resumes operations to provide emergency humanitarian assistance such as famine support and HIV prevention, the agency is still likely to terminate all its climate-related work under the Trump administration. The result would be a blow to the landmark Paris climate agreement just as significant as Trumpâs formal withdrawal of the US from the international pact. By clawing back billions of dollars that Congress has already committed to the fight against global warming, the US is poised to derail climate progress far beyond its own borders. âThis is taking a torch to development programs that the American people have paid for,â said Gillian Caldwell, who served as USAIDâs chief climate officer under former president Biden. âMany commitments under the Paris Agreement are funding-contingent, and thatâs very much in peril.â The United States spends less than 1 percent of its federal budget on foreign aid, but that still makes the country the largest aid donor in the world by far. USAID distributes between $40 billion and $60 billion per yearâalmost a quarter of all global humanitarian aid. While in recent years the largest shares of that aid have gone to Ukraine, Israel, and Afghanistan, the agency also distributes billions of dollars to Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, where it primarily helps promote food security, health and sanitation, and education efforts. In 2022, Caldwell led the launch of a sweeping new âclimate strategyâ that sought to reposition USAIDâs work over the next decade to account for climate shocks. The first part of this initiative was a country-by-country review of existing aid flows in standard areas like food and sanitation. USAID offices around the world began tweaking their operations to ensure the projects they were funding would hold up as temperatures continue to rise. For example, the agency would ensure water and sewer systems could handle bigger floods, or would plan to inoculate against  diseases that might spread faster in warm weather . The effort was especially important in sectors like agriculture, which is both emissions-heavy and extremely vulnerable to the weather shocks that come with even small climactic shifts. âYouâre going to be having a lot more demands on humanitarian assistance when youâve got extreme weather events,â she said. âThe point was to make sure that every dollar weâre spending is sensible given the world we live in today.â In addition to that review, the agency also increased its direct spending on renewable energy, conservation, and climate adaptation. The agency added dozens of new countries to its climate aid portfolio under Bidenâs tenure, expanding in Southeast Asia and Western Africa. USAID work has had a far greater effect on the climate fight than its raw spending, which totaled around $600 million on climate efforts in 2023, would indicate. Thatâs because the agencyâs support has also mobilized billions of dollars from the private sector, attracting investment from renewable energy developers and insurance companies that offer drought and flood coverage to vulnerable areas abroad. USAIDâs renewable energy efforts may be some of the most resilient to Trumpâs shock attack, because they donât rely on the agencyâs continued involvement. USAID has helped several countries design and hold renewable energy auctions, wherein private companies bid for the right to build new power facilities at low prices. These auctions save countries money and make it easier for them to attract private capital. In the Philippines,  two USAID-sponsored auctions  generated almost $7 billion in investment to build 5.4 gigawatts of solar and wind energy, enough to power millions of homesâwithout further USAID support. The agencyâs  spending on landscape conservation  is less secure. That funding prevents development on sensitive natural environments like rainforests by paying nearby residents to seek livelihoods other than the logging and grazing that could unleash massive emissions from the carbon stored in the forests. If USAID collapses, that aid will dry up, jeopardizing millions of acres of climate-friendly land. The largest portion of the USAIDâs climate-related spending goes toward disaster resilience, which doesnât attract much investment from banks and private companies, making government support crucial. In the case of Zimbabwe, for instance, the agency funds dozens of projects a year that are intended to make the countryâs farmers more resilient to drought and flooding. (This is in addition to public health and AIDS relief provided to the country, which together account for the majority of its USAID funding.) Women use a depleted well in rural Zimbabwe in the summer of 2024, during an El NiÃ±o-induced drought. USAID has spent millions of dollars on drought support in the country.   Photograph: JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/Getty Images One of the largest disaster relief programs in Zimbabwe, a broad-based initiative to  help smallholder farmers , has increased water stability for tens of thousands of households by helping them build small rain catchment systems and restore degraded soils. USAID has been funding the project to the tune of about $12 million annually since 2020, and the program was slated to continue for the next three years. Zimbabweâs minister for climate and the environment, Washington Zhakata, said that a shutoff of USAID funding will make it nearly impossible for the country to meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement. The country has promised not only to develop renewable energy, but also to spend huge amounts of money on drought and flood protections. It has developed a nationwide adaptation plan on the premise that future funding would be providedâand provided in large part by the countries that are responsible for the most carbon emissions historically, like the US. âWith limited and reduced resources, as a result of the funding withdrawal, meeting our compliance will be an uphill task,â Zhakata told Grist. âThe created finance gap will see developing countries have to live with minimum resources and also to squeeze from domestic sources.â At times, USAID has faced criticism for inefficient spending and unclear resultsâincluding for its past climate spending. The agencyâs inspector general released a report last summer that criticized USAIDâs previous climate initiatives for having murky data, saying that âweaknesses in the agencyâs processes for awarding funds, managing performance, and communicating climate change information could impede successful implementation.â The inspector generalâs report also called USAIDâs measurements of climate progress into question. In another  report last year , the agency said that its new clean energy investments in Pakistan will cut around 55 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, the equivalent of taking around 10 million average cars off the road. In Brazil, the agency said it has conserved around 118 million acres of forest land, which will sequester millions of tons of carbon. The inspector general said results like these are âhighly susceptible to inaccuracies,â because the emissions results havenât yet happened. Some experts also argue that the agencyâs humanitarian aid programs donât focus enough on reducing long-term risk. Food security specialists who spoke to Grist during a  2023 famine in Somalia  said that USAID provided emergency food assistance in the country as pastoralists lost their income, but it didnât provide enough funding to help those shepherds adapt to future droughts. Caldwell, the former USAID climate officer, said the agency has reduced long-term risk by trying to reduce emissions on emergency aid deliveries and ensure new infrastructure can survive future disasters. While the first Trump administration tried to zero out climate aid in every round of annual budget negotiations,  some Senate Republicans resisted  and kept aid flows more or less level. This time around, thereâs no guarantee that Republicans in Congress will show the same resistance to Trumpâs demandsâand no guarantee that the administration will comply with laws requiring it to spend the money that Congress appropriates. If Musk, whom Trump has made a special government employee to conduct his Department of Government Efficiency vision, overcomes court challenges and succeeds in clearing out USAID staff and shutting down the agencyâs typical operations, it will take a new administration and years of work to restore the flow of climate aid, assuming Congress votes to restore it as well. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, but the US is still a member of the broader United Nations climate convention, and only Congress has the power to withdraw it from that convention. The original framework text, which the US adopted in 1992, says that rich countries like the US âshall provideâ aid to help poorer countries meet their climate goals. In a statement about the USAID shutdown, Manish Bapna, head of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, connected the shuttering of USAID to Trumpâs withdrawal from the 2015 Paris accord. âSimilar to the Paris climate agreement exit, this action simply narrows the window for essential climate and global health actions, while delivering no benefit to American taxpayers,â he said. âThis is a curiously counterproductive and poorly timed move that comes as the world is facing grave climate, health, environmental, and economic crisesâall of which will be worsened by this assault on USAID.â Editorâs note: The Natural Resources Defense Council is an advertiser with Grist.

    "body": "As Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  has ravaged its way though the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), cutting its  workforce from 10,000 to just 300 , hundreds of organizations providing vital safety services have been upended. Multiple childrenâs safety groupsâincluding those fighting online child sexual abuse and exploitationâsay their efforts have been severely hamstrung. Groups identifying victims and providing care for those who have been subject to online exploitation or human trafficking are struggling to support the vulnerable children, multiple organizations tell WIRED. Such child safety projects often take place in poorer countries, which can have fewer resources to support victims or investigate crimes. Sources say that funding for safe houses has been paused, potentially exposing victims to more harm, and efforts that identify criminals behind child exploitation have been put on hold. âIt will be very hard for us to identify the victims,â says Chantal Yelu Mulop, from the Coordination for Youth and the Fight Against Sexual Violence and Trafficking in Persons (CJVFFT), in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the  war-torn country faces new fighting and humanitarian crises , children have long been trafficked to work in cobalt mines linked to the  production of smartphone and EV batteries . As USAID funding was withdrawn over the past week, Mulop says her organization had just started helping around 25 newly identified victims of human traffickingâall of them aged under 17. The group was taken to a support shelter run by another organization. âWhen we bring them there, USAID was ready to help. A few hours later they cancel,â Mulop says. âThereâs no food, no nothing that we can provide to them,â she adds. While the USAID cuts have been immediate, global child protection projects have also faced a funding pause from the State Department. This foreign aid â pause ,â issued by the Trump administration, is set to last for at least 90 days. USAID did not respond to WIREDâs request for comment. The State Department had not provided a comment by time of publication. Both government bodies have provided funding to help countries and people around the world. This includes USAIDâs vast swath of health care and education programsâtheir withdrawal is  putting millions of lives at risk  and  limits tackling the climate crisis . In Southeast Asia, several patients at a migrant camp reportedly  died after medical support was removed . Counter-human-trafficking funding often includes money for projects that help to crack down on online child exploitation and sexual abuse. Funding can be provided to international organizations that coordinate efforts and work with partners, like Mulopâs CJVFFT, on the ground. The funding can directly support victims, as well as providing expertise to officials in countries, and stop more children becoming targets. âMany of these victims engage with their traffickers through electronic means,â says Jessica Ryckman, the executive director of the nonprofit Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB), which works on trafficking and child exploitation programs and has been impacted by the funding changes. âIt is exploitation that is advanced through digital technology.â Over the years, the programs have been effective. For instance, a four-year partnership between the US and the Philippines, which started under the first Trump administration and ended in 2021, helped protect hundreds of children: More than  350 kids were rescued and supported and almost 100 potential criminals arrested . The new cuts also come as  record levels  of online child sexual abuse imagery are being discovered. âVictims and perpetrators alike originate from diverse regions and countries, underscoring the necessity for continued international engagement and coordinated efforts to address these crimes comprehensively,â says an employee of a South American child protection group that works to combat trafficking and online sexual abuse. The organization, like others in this story, was granted anonymity to speak given the sensitive nature of the work and uncertainty about future funding. âThe interruption of these funds inevitably limits the scope and reach of these critical services,â it says. One person, who works for an organization running multiple child protection projects, says operations in one southeastern European country have been widely disrupted. Within the country, the organizationâs projects have 147 victims of trafficking in its care, the person says. âThe ongoing pause and potentially the cessation of funding would have significant and negative impact on our capacity and ability to provide essential services to these victims who are in fragile stages of their recovery; some of whom are in ongoing programs for psycho-social counseling related to their trauma,â the person says. Multiple members of LWOB say children are being put further at risk in the projects it runs in East Africa. âThese children may not be identified, the practices to reduce their trauma aren't being supported right now,â says Ryckman. âEven if they are identified, they may be put in a pipeline where they are going to have to face ongoing interviews about their trauma or face their traffickers again.â LWOB has, along with partner organizations, identified around 200 victims of human trafficking in Tanzania, with the majority referred to safe houses, says Lulu Makwale, a victim service coordinator at Lawyers Without Borders. âMost of the funding for the safe houses has been paused, meaning the services and the needs of the victim are also being paused too,â Makwale says. She says the organization has been linking up shelters to investigators up until now. âVictims may not be connected well now to the law enforcement,â Makwale says. As well as supporting victims directly, many of the efforts also provide training or technical assistance to police forces, allowing them to better investigate crimes. One program listed on the  State Departmentâs list of counter-trafficking  funding says it is providing training to combat online child sexual exploitation for 10,000 police officers, prosecutors, and judges in 100 countries. The person with links to work in a European country says their organization has 74 investigations into traffickers ongoing, plus 66 prosecutions that are underway. They say that the funding changes will have a âsignificant and negative impact on these criminal trialsâ and the safety of people who may give evidence in the cases. Ryckman, from Lawyers Without Borders, says the organization recently completed work on an online database for identifying victims and tracking online child exploitation in Kenya. While the database is functional, Ryckman says, future work to train people has been paused, and there will be a slower uptake of the system. âI do believe it will be used, and it will be extremely useful,â Ryckman says. âBut these victims are there now. They shouldnât have to wait.â",

    "header": "NIH Funding Cuts Appear to Draw on Heritage Foundation Report That Blasts âDEI Staffâ",
    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-10 18:29:27",
    "body": "A US National Institutes of Health notice announcing a drastic cut in federal science funding appears to draw heavily on a 2022 report by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. The report argues that the so-called indirect research costs targeted by the cuts contribute to the âmassive growth in DEI staff at US universities.â The NIH policy change, announced on  February 7 , dramatically reduces the amount of funding that accompanies NIH grants to cover indirect costsâmoney that universities put toward building maintenance, administration, support staff wages, regulatory compliance, and safety requirements associated with funded research. The cuts, which standardize indirect costs at 15 percent of the grant size, will be potentially devastating for research universities that are heavily dependent on federal grants. Many universities directly negotiate these rates, which historically average 27 to 28 percent, with some universities receiving over 60 percent. Stanford University alone is facing a reduction of  $160 million , with many other research universities facing reductions in the tens or  hundreds of millions of dollars . The wider economies of university cities will also be hit, as indirect research costs are used to pay laborers, administrators, janitors, technicians, and other support staff. All of this comes on top of the deep cuts Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency  have inflicted across  government departments . In the notice announcing the change, the NIH argued that private foundations provide much lower rates of indirect costs than the federal government. To make that argument, the NIH notice draws heavily on what appears to be an analysis from a  2022 report  from the Heritage Foundation called âIndirect Costs: How Taxpayers Subsidize University Nonsense.â The authors of that report, Jay Greene and John Schoof, claim that indirect costs have been used to âsubsidize the agenda of the political leftâ and fund DEI staff on university campuses. Reducing indirect costs, the authors allege, would âdramatically reduce the amount of money available to spend on political activismâ as well as âuniversitiesâ ability to install more DEI staff.â The report claims that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal indirect cost rate is associated with 2.1 additional DEI employees, while a $100 million increase in the total amount of indirect costs received by a university is associated with 15.5 additional DEI employees. âCurrently, taxpayers are forced to subsidize the agenda of the political left through funding its research agendas and DEI staff on university campuses,â the authors of the 2022 report wrote. âThe Left has used the indirect cost reimbursement system to capture an important professional institution.\" The NIH notice does not mention DEI, and the Heritage Foundation report does not recommend a 15 percent cap specifically. But the federal agency justifies its slashed rate in part by citing a ârecent analysisâ that found that 67 out of 72 universities were willing to accept research grants with no indirect cost coverage. While the notice does not provide a source for that analysis, it appears to have originated in the Heritage Foundation report. The 2022 report includes an analysis of 82 universities, the indirect cost rate they receive from federal grants, and the indirect cost rate they receive from private funders such as the Sloan Foundation, Gates Foundation, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Ten of the schools in the Heritage Foundation analysis did not confirm their indirect cost rates for private funders, leaving 72 full entries in the reportâs analysis. Of those 72 universities, the report claimed that 67 accepted private research grants with zero percent indirect research cost coverageâexactly the same analysis and finding as in the NIH notice. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former NIH employee, or a scientist who has been impacted by this administration? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact our reporters securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45 and emullin.06. The Heritage Foundation report concluded that just three schools in the sample refuse to accept indirect cost rates from private foundations at lower rates than those they negotiated with the federal government. Those schools are the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Massachusetts Institute for Technology, and the University of Michigan. The NIH notice refers to the same three schools without identifying the Heritage Foundation as the source of the analysis. It mentions that Harvard required a minimum 15 percent indirect cost coverage from private funders and that California Institute of Technology required a 20 percent indirect cost coverage. These examples also appear in the Heritage Foundation report. One of the reportâs authors, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Jay Greene, says he was not involved in drafting the NIH notice but did acknowledge that one paragraph of the NIH notice âdoes appear to be a reference to our 2022 report.â The NIH did not respond to WIREDâs request for comments. A plan to cut indirect cost rates in federal grants also appears in Project 2025, the nearly thousand-page Heritage Foundation policy blueprint for a second Trump presidency. âThis market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,â the report reads. During his presidential campaign, Trump consistently disavowed any links to the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025. On Monday, a  coalition of 22 states  filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the NIHâs attempt to cut indirect costs. Universities say the cap will hamper their ability to do vital research. âThe discovery of new treatments would slow, opportunities to train the next generation of scientific leaders would shrink, and our nationâs science and engineering prowess would be severely compromised,â wrote  Harvard president  Alan Garber in a post on the universityâs website. Some universities stand to lose more than $100 million in federal funding if the new grant cap is maintained. According  to STAT , Weill Cornell Medicine brought in $107 million in indirect costs during 2022âa figure that would drop to $23 million if the rate had been 15 percent.",

    "header": "Federal Workers Launch New Lawsuit to Fight DOGEâs Data Access",
    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-11 17:13:10",
    "body": "A new lawsuit filed by more than 100 federal workers today in the US Southern District Court of New York alleges that the Trump administrationâs decision to give Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to their  sensitive personal data  is illegal. The plaintiffs are asking the court for an injunction to cut off DOGEâs access to information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which functions as the HR department of the United States and houses data on federal workers such as their Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and personnel files. WIRED  previously reported  that Musk and people with connections to him had taken over OPM. âOPM defendants gave DOGE defendants and DOGEâs agentsâmany of whom are under the age of 25 and are or were until recently employees of Muskâs private companiesââadministrativeâ access to OPM computer systems, without undergoing any normal, rigorous national-security vetting,â the complaint alleges. The plaintiffs accuse DOGE of violating the Privacy Act, a 1974 law that determines how the government can collect, use, and store personal information. Elon Musk, the DOGE organization, the Office of Personnel Management, and the OPMâs acting director Charles Ezell are named as defendants in the case. The plaintiffs include over a hundred individual federal workers from across the US government as well as groups that represent them, including AFL-CIO, a coalition of labor unions, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the Association of Administrative Law Judges. The AFGE represents over 800,000 federal workers ranging from Social Security Administration employees to border patrol agents. The plaintiffs are represented by prominent tech industry lawyers, including counsel from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, as well as Mark Lemley, an intellectual property and tech lawyer who recently  dropped Meta  as a client in its contentious AI copyright lawsuit because he objected to what he alleges is the companyâs embrace of âneo-Nazi madness.â âDOGE's unlawful access to employee records turns out to be the means by which they are trying to accomplish a number of other illegal ends. It is how they got a list of all government employees to make their illegal buyout offer, for instance. It gives them access to information about transgender employees so they can illegally discriminate against those employees. And it lays the groundwork for the illegal firings we have seen across multiple departments,â Lemley told WIRED. EFF lawyer Victoria Noble says there are heightened concerns about DOGEâs data access because of the political nature of Muskâs project. For example, Noble says, thereâs a risk that Musk and his acolytes may use OPM data to target ideological opponents or âpeople they see as disloyal.â âThere's significant risk that this information could be used to identify employees to essentially terminate based on improper considerations,â Noble told WIRED. âThere's medical information, there's disability information, there's information about people's involvement with unions.â The Office of Personnel Management and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The team behind the lawsuit plans to push even further. âThis is just phase one, focused on getting an injunction to stop the continuing violation of the law,â says Lemley. The next phase will include filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of impacted federal workers. âAny current or former federal employee who spends or loses even a small amount of money responding to the data breach, for example, by purchasing credit monitoring services, is entitled to a minimum of $1000 in statutory damages,â Lemley says. The complaint specifies that the plaintiffs have already paid for credit monitoring and web monitoring services to protect themselves against DOGE potentially mishandling their data. The lawsuit is part of a flurry of complaints filed in recent days opposing various executive orders signed by Trump as well as activities conducted by DOGE, which has dispatched a cadre of Musk loyalists to radically overhaul and sometimes  effectively dismantle  various government agencies. An earlier lawsuit  filed against the Office of Personnel Management  on January 27 alleges that DOGE was operating an illegal server at OPM. On Monday, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy-focused nonprofit, brought its own  lawsuit  against OPM, the US Department of the Treasury, and DOGE, alleging âthe largest and most consequential data breach in US history.â Filed in a US District Court in Virginia, it also called for an injunction to halt DOGEâs access to sensitive data. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has similarly  characterized DOGEâs data access  as potentially illegal in a letter to members of Congress sent last week. The courts have already taken some limited actions to curb DOGEâs campaign. On Saturday, a federal judge  blocked Muskâs lieutenants from accessing Treasury Department records  that contained sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers. The Trump Administration is already aggressively pushing back,  calling  the order âunprecedented judicial interference.â Today, President Trump  reportedly prepared  to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to work with DOGE.",

    "body": "Dozens of  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau employees  were terminated on Tuesday evening, sources tell WIRED. The cuts largely targeted contractors and so-called probationary employees, workers who have served less than two years at the agency. Sources tell WIRED that the CFPBâs enforcement division was hit hard, but itâs unclear how many employees were let go. Workers were informed that they had been fired with a frenetic email delivered around 9 pm ET on Tuesday. An evidently failed mail merge meant that some affected employees were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division]. âThis is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of [Job Title] and federal service consistent with the above references,â the email from acting chief human capital officer Adam Martinez says. âUnfortunately, the Agency finds that that [sic] you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agencyâs current needs.â The firings follow a tumultuous few days at the CFPB. On Friday, staff for Elon Muskâs  Department of Government Efficiency  shut down a portion of the agencyâs homepage after a day of struggling to obtain access to the CMS and other systems. WIRED reported last week that three DOGE staffers, including Gavin Kliger and Nikhil Rajpal, were given access to the CFPBâs HR, procurement, and financial infrastructure. The DOGE workers were later granted access to all of the agencyâs systems on Friday,  Bloomberg reported this week , including bank examination and enforcement records. Later on Friday evening, Russell VoughtâPresident Trumpâs newly confirmed director of the Office of Management and Budgetâtook over as the acting administrator for the CFPB late Friday evening, as first reported by  The Wall Street Journal . Soon after, DOGE staff began sending out email requests asking CFPB managers to give Kliger additional access to agency systems, including physical access control system, payroll processing systems, and the ability to edit the CFPBâs website, sources tell WIRED. Just before 10:30 pm ET on Friday, sources say, someone who appeared to have administrative privileges accessed the agency server using Secure Shell, a protocol that allows remote control of a computer over a network. Bypassing the content management system, they unpublished the homepage file, causing a portion of the CFPB homepage to display a â404: Page not foundâ notice typical of a website that has been deleted or is otherwise missing. The remainder of the site was functional, including submission forms for industry whistleblowers and consumer complaints. Around 11 pm on Friday, the CFPBâs X account disappeared, and shortly after, according to a CFPB staffer, DOGE left the building. CFPB sources who spoke to WIRED described being blindsided by the DOGE staffers. \"They said they would follow protocol but repeatedly did not,\" one says, noting that the level of access these staffers have could allow them to lock others out of the building, take down the website, and âobstruct the bureauâs ability to carry out its mandate.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32 and dmehro.89. One source at CFPB on Friday says they saw two young DOGE staffers wandering through the halls of the building trying to open doors. âDOGE pulled a Darth Vader in cloud city where they came in promising to respect our rules and ask for read access and then tonight [Friday] at 6 they took a heel turn and demanded website access,â another CFPB source told WIRED at the time. In a pair of emails sent Saturday and Monday, Vought effectively ordered all work at the agency to stop, freezing various enforcement efforts and work on  regulations that would affect payment programs run by Big Tech companies . The CFPB has long been a target of both Elon Musk and conservatives more broadly; the Project 2025 chapter on financial regulatory agencies describes it as âa highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agencyâ and calls to have it abolished. Musk wrote âRIP CFPBâ with a gravestone emoji in an X post Friday afternoon. In November, he posted âDelete CFPB.â There are around 1,700 employees in  total  at the agency. The CFPB was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that imposed significant regulatory reform in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Its remit is to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive financial practices, and the agency  claims to be  responsible for $19.7 billion in consumer relief since its inception, as well as $5 billion in civil penalties. Some of those wins have come against payment processors including Block, which last month was  ordered  to pay $175 million in penalties for allegedly failing to sufficiently protect users of its Cash App from fraud. The CFPB also has an active  lawsuit  against JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo for similar alleged failures on their shared payment app Zelle. Elon Musk will soon be in the peer-to-peer payments business as well, after X entered a  partnership  with Visa in late January.",

    "body": "The Chinese government announced Tuesday it is opening an investigation into  Google  in response to 10 percent tariffs imposed on Chinese imports by US president Donald Trump. Minutes  after the tariffs  went into effect, Chinaâs State Administration for Market Regulation said it was probing the American tech giant for potentially violating the countryâs anti-monopoly law. The Chinese government may have strategically chosen to go after Google because it has limited operations in the country, ensuring the hit to the US tech giant would be relatively minimal. The move gives China plenty of room to escalate if the Trump administration announces further tariffs or other trade measures. Google declined to comment. China also announced it was putting more restrictions on the sale of some critical minerals like tungsten and slapping additional tariffs on farm equipment, pickup trucks, liquified natural gas, coal, and other goods from the US. While the US isnât reliant on China for all of the impacted minerals, the country does control the majority of the worldâs tungsten supply, which is used in light bulbs, semiconductors, and ammunition. âChinaâs position is firm and consistent. Trade and tariff wars have no winners,â Chinaâs Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a  statement  Sunday shortly after the tariffs were announced. âThis move cannot solve the USâs problems at home and, more importantly, does not benefit either side, still less the world.â China has kept Google in its crosshairs during the ongoing trade war with the US over the last few years. In 2020, the government reportedly  considered opening  an antitrust investigation into Google's Android business, according to Reuters. The deliberations followed a complaint from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which was targeted by Trump during his first term. Because of US sanctions, Huawei is unable to use American-made software like Google Mobile Services, a suite of tools widely used across the smartphone industry. The restrictions forced the company to develop  its own operating system  called Harmony OS. But most smartphones  around the world still run  on Android, which has sparked competition investigations in a number of countries, some of which have led to  concessionary changes  designed to give consumers and app developers more choices and lower fees. In China, several  smartphone makers  continue to rely on an open source version of Android. This past December, Chinese authorities also opened an anti-monopoly investigation into Nvidia, the chipmaker whose GPUs play a crucial role in the development of generative AI and have become a  significant source  of trade sparring between the US and China. The announcement came soon after the Biden administration  further tightened  Chinaâs access to high-end semiconductors. About 15 years ago, Google  stopped offering  a search experience tailored for China following a series of Chinese government-linked  cyberattacks  against it and other US companies. Google  debated  reentering China with a search engine about  seven years ago , but the project  was scuttled  following protests from some employees concerned about supporting Chinese surveillance and censorship. Google has also stopped short of directly selling  cloud technologies in China , as local laws could threaten the privacy and security assurances it offers to customers in other markets. Other Google services  such as YouTube  are blocked by Chinese internet regulators. China has allowed domestic companies to buy advertisements through Google so that they can market to customers abroad. But the revenue from those deals is relatively small, and China didn't even garner a mention in parent company Alphabet's  annual financial report  last year. That stands in contrast to Meta,  which lists  China among its biggest markets in terms of advertiser location and said last year that China-based advertisers  account for 10 percent of its annual revenue .",

    "body": "The thing about the  takeover of key US government institutions  by the worldâs richest man and his  strike force of former interns  is that itâs happening so fast. Itâs been three weeks since Elon Muskâs agents took over the  governmentâs IT  and  HR departments . Since then, the movements of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have had the cartography of a horror movie,  DOGE  picking off agencies one by one based on slasher logic, feeding an unslakeable thirst for cost-cutting and data. Every day brings fresh incursions. Three weeks ago the United States believed in  humanitarian aid . It helped people who had been ripped off by big corporations. It funded the infrastructure necessary to make America a beacon of scientific innovation. Now the  United States Agency for International Development  is gutted, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  is on ice, and  National Institutes of Health  grants are handcuffed. So much for all that. These are spreadsheet cruelties, executed with a click. The loss of real peoplesâ jobs and livesâyes, despite what X-famous conspiracy theorists will tell you,  USAID saved lives âall immaterial compared to the pursuit of a tighter balance sheet. Three weeks ago, a 19-year-old who calls himself â Big Balls â online didnât have access to government personnel records and more. A 25-year-old with a closet full of racist tweets hadnât gotten the  keys to Treasury systems that pay out $5.45 trillion each year . Elon Musk hadnât turned the Oval Office into a romper room for his 4-year-old son. The speed is strategy, of course, flooding the zone so that neither the media nor the courts can keep pace. Lawsuits and court orders move on a different timescale than this slash-and-burn approach. (At this pace, DOGE will have tapped into every last government server long before the Supreme Court even has a chance to weigh in.) But itâs also reflexive. The first order of business in a corporate takeover is to slash costs as quickly as possible. If you canât fire people, offer them buyouts. If they wonât take the buyouts, find a way to fire them anyway. Keep cutting until you hit bone. This is how you get an  executive order  declaring that âeach agency hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart,â an arbitrary ratio with no regard for actual staffing needs. Itâs how you get  hundreds of federal government buildings on the auction block  no matter how fully occupied they are. Itâs both extreme and ill-considered, a race to empty the townâs only well. And then â¦ what? This is the question that Elon Musk and DOGE have failed to answer, because there is no answer. Does the United States government need to become a profit engine? To return shareholder value? Does Medicaid need to demonstrate a product-market fit in time for the next funding round? This is consultant logic. This is an engineering sprint whose inevitable finish line is the unwinding of the social contract. Democracy doesnât die in darkness after all; it dies in JIRA tickets filed by  Palantir alums . Itâs somehow even worse than that, though. Suppose you take this whole enterprise at face value, that the United States should go through the  private equity ringer . It does not take a Stanford MBA to know that cutting expenses only helps half of your profit and loss statement. Any serious attempt to treat the US like a business would involve increasing revenues. So where are the taxes? And why demolish the CFPB, which has paid out over  $20 billion to US citizens âshareholders, if you willâthrough its enforcement actions? In the coming weeks and months, as this farce continues to unfurl, remember that the goal of most acquisitions is not to benefit the acquired. It is to either subsume or discard, whichever generates the highest return. Elon Muskâs unprecedented influence over the executive branch will ultimately benefit Elon Musk. The employees in charge are  his employees . The data DOGE collects, the procurement contracts they oversee, it all flows up to him. And itâs flowing too quickly to keep up with, much less to stop.

    "body": "At least dozens of workers for the  Technology Transformation Services , housed within the US  General Services Administration , were fired Wednesday afternoon, sources tell WIRED. The sudden cuts seemingly targeted probationary and short-term staffers, including workers supplied by the Presidential Innovation Fellowship program, which brings skilled technologists from the private sector to work in government for a few years at a time. Around 50 of the 70 members of the US Digital Corps, an early-career, two-year government fellowship, were terminated as well, sources say. Sources also tell WIRED that TTS management met with workers individually prior to the terminations, giving them one last chance to take the deferred resignation offered in the âFork in the Roadâ email from  late last month . One TTS staffer called the meetings âcoercive for sure.â Itâs unclear how many people are being let go, but multiple sources tell WIRED that list could be upwards of 70 if not more. Prior, there were around 650 TTS employees. Fired staffers are expected to receive a formal termination email later Wednesday evening. âFrom the beginning of this administration, GSAâs leadership has been committed to supporting the administration's initiatives to rightsize the federal workforce. GSA has taken immediate action to fully implement all current executive orders and is committed to taking action to implement any new executive orders,â a GSA spokesperson tells WIRED. âLike all agencies, GSA has been working to meet OPM [Office of Personnel Management] memo requirements as it relates to probationary periods. GSA has been and remains committed to ensuring a respectful and dignified process for our agency personnel during this transformation.â Terminated employeesâ last day is expected to be March 7, sources say.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely using a personal device on Signal at makenakelly.32. Similar firings took place at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  on Tuesday evening. Dozens of staffers, primarily probationary ones with fewer than two years of service, received termination emails. Due to what appeared to be a failed mail merge, fired workers were addressed as [EmployeeFirstName][EmployeeLastName], [Job Title], [Division]. When Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla software engineer, joined TTS, he told staff to expect workforce cuts. âWe should expect that GSA will be operating with a significantly smaller budget and significantly reduced staff in future,â Shedd told TTS staffers in an all-hands meeting last week in audio obtained by WIRED. GSAâs vision for the TTS, under new leadership, is an agency that runs like a âstartup software company,â  WIRED reported last week , focusing on AI, automating different internal processes, and centralizing data from across the federal government. GSA was one of the first agencies  Musk associates  took over once President Donald Trump returned to power. Nicole Hollander, who aided Musk in his Twitter acquisition, has joined the upper levels of GSA, along with a slew of other  young technologists  associated with Musk companies. The reductions in head count come as Shedd and TTS leadership are hoping to launch âGSAi,â a custom generative AI chatbot, within the next few weeks.  WIRED recently reported  that the goal of this initiative is to increase productivity among staff and to analyze massive amounts of data. The agency is also planning to sell  more than 500 federal buildings  to cut overall costs, while pushing for employees to return to in-person office work. On Wednesday evening,  a federal judge allowed the Trump administration  to continue with its plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce.

    "body": "This morning, workers at the  US Treasury Departmentâs Bureau of the Fiscal Service  (BFS) received an email announcing that Tom Krause, a software executive and  Elon Musk ally , was \"appointed to perform the delegated duties of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary.â That role was previously occupied by David Lebryk, who  resigned after refusing  to allow Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive systems within the Treasury Department. Though it had been  previously reported  that Krause, who had been called a special government employee, had obtained Lebrykâs old position, the email also notably states that Krause is âcurrently the CEO of Cloud Software Group.â âTom brings more than 20 years of experience leading, building, and positioning software and technology companies for value and long-term success,â the email reads. âTom is currently the CEO of Cloud Software Group which manages and operates multiple mission critical enterprise software businesses.â In response to questions from WIRED, a representative for the company said that âTom is the CEO of Cloud Software Groupâ and forwarded a copy of an email sent to the companyâs employees last week in which Krause wrote, âin addition to my duties as CEO of Cloud Software Group, I am advising the US Department of Treasury as a âspecial government employee.â I am honored to serve our country.â Critics believe Krause retaining his job in addition to serving in the government could be a massive  conflict of interest . Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cloud Software Group did not respond to questions about whether Krause would continue to draw a salary from the company during his time with the Treasury. In an affidavit filed Thursday in the  lawsuit   Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury , Krause wrote, âWhile in this Treasury role, I have also maintained my employment as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cloud Software Group, Inc., which [is] a privately held company comprised of several enterprise software businesses. This arrangement has been approved by Treasuryâs ethics office, who determined, based on my role as an SGE, that this arrangement was permissible.\" In the same affidavit, Krause said, âI have not yet assumed those duties\" as Fiscal Assistant Secretary. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee that wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at velliott88.18. âI cannot think of another example where this has occurred, but I do think it's part of a broader pattern of the erasure of conflicts of interests within the federal government,â says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. âFederal employees can't take more than a $25 gift from someone who might be trying to influence their actions. On the other hand, their bosses are simultaneously running private companies while also running parts of the government that affect their businesses.â Treasury in particular, he says, could pose a conflict of interest across industries because âit affects everything.â And any alleged conflicts of interest may not be limited to just Krauseâs own company. âThere is a network of people coming from Silicon Valley and corporate America now that are working together,â Moynihan says. âAnd so it's not just about the conflict of interest he might have with his business, but the way in which he's situated to help that broader network that are now effectively running the government.â Although Treasury and White House officials have gone  back  and  forth  about DOGEâs access to Treasury payment systems,  WIRED has reported  that, at one point, DOGE had both read and write access.  Marko Elez , one of a number of  young men identified by WIRED  who have little to no government experience but are associated with DOGE, was granted read and write privileges on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the BFS, an agency that, according to Treasury records, paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. (An affidavit filed in the same  Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury  lawsuit by a Bureau of the Fiscal Service official claims Elez only had read and write access to the SPS.) A federal judge last week granted an order to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and changing Treasury payment system information, following a lawsuit alleging that the Treasury Department provided âElon Musk or other individuals associated with DOGEâ access to the payment systems and that this access violated federal privacy laws. The order, however, specifically provided a carve-out for Krause and Elez, though their access was supposed to be restricted to â read only .â A subsequent order  blocked  DOGE members from access to payment systems. In response to the Trump administrationâs objections that the order would block people with legitimate need to access systems, such as the Treasury secretary and contractors, the order was loosened to note that âthe Secretary of the Treasury and other Senate-confirmed senior Treasury Officers are not prohibited from accessing Treasury's payment systems.â This would appear to leave Krause barred from access to the very systems the Fiscal Assistant Secretary oversees. Last week, the threat intelligence team at one of the Treasuryâs agencies recommended that DOGE members be  monitored as an âinsider threat,â  WIRED reported. An internal email sent to the BFSâs IT division and others called DOGE staffâs access to federal payments systems âthe single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.â âWe are running out of ways to say âunprecedented,ââ says Moynihan. Earlier today, the Office of the Inspector General at the Treasury  said  it would be auditing the governmentâs payment systems in response to concerns raised by Democratic senators about DOGEâs access. It will also be examining the past two years of payments to evaluate whether any have been fraudulent, which  Musk has alleged . Matt Giles contributed reporting.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-12 15:56:15",
    "body": "Employees at the  General Services Administration  (GSA) have been told to sell off 500-plus  federal government  buildings across the US, sources tell WIRED. WIRED obtained a complete list of GSA buildings, all of which are designated as âcoreâ or ânon-coreâ assets. Of the more than 1,500 assets identified on the list, over 900 are designated as âcoreâ and are thus protected, for now, from sale. The âcoreâ designation applies to buildings like federal courthouses, border inspection stations, or law enforcement facilities. The GSA, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, plans to sell most of the remaining 500-plus buildings, some of which house government agencies and the offices of US senators. A note on the list of the buildings states that the agencyâs intention is eventually to reduce the âsize of the owned real estate footprint by 50 percent and the number of buildings by 70 percent. Reductions will be focused on the non-core general office space of the portfolio which can be replaced as needed in the private leased market. Moving forward, all non-core buildings will be disposed of and their tenants will be transitioned into leases.â GSA, a  critical government agency  that manages federal buildings and technology, has been staffed with  Elon Muskâs associates , including X staffer Nicole Hollander, who has high-level agency access and an official government email address. Thomas Shedd, the recently installed director of the Technology Transformation Services within GSA, worked as a software engineer at Tesla for eight years.  WIRED also reported that a number of young engineers  with ties to Muskâs companies and little to no government experience have been given access to a number of government agencies, including GSA. According to the list, the buildings destined for the block include the  John C. Kluczynski Federal Building  in Chicago, which houses satellite offices for the Department of Labor, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, a probation office, and offices for Democratic Illinois senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. The building also has broader cultural significanceâit was designed by renowned architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and features an iconic Alexander Calder sculpture. The John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston is also listed as a ânon-coreâ asset. This building, in addition to  housing a number of government agencies , also holds offices for Democratic Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey. The Ed Jones Federal Building in Jackson, Tennessee, which holds an office for Republican senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as Republican congressman David Kustoff, is also listed as a ânon-coreâ asset. âOptimizing GSAâs real estate portfolio prioritizes reducing our deferred maintenance liabilities, supporting the return to office of federal employees, and taking advantage of a stronger private/government partnership in managing the workforce of the future,â reads a press release from GSA issued today. GSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. âThe intention of GSA and the whole federal government is to reduce the number of old buildings that are owned with high liabilities â¦ in favor of newer leased buildings, which can be more flexible and are more modern, that have ways for teams to collaborate and have private spaces,â Shedd told TTS staffers in a meeting on February 5, according to audio obtained by WIRED.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86. Slimming down the federal governmentâs real estate portfolio, and the associated maintenance costs, has been a  priority for the agency  since before Donald Trumpâs inauguration. A number of buildings are in poor repair, underutilized, or ill-suited for modern office layouts. In 2023, the GSA divested a total of five buildings, and identified 23 additional properties for future divestment. Now that target appears to be an order of magnitude higher. The commercial real estate (CRE) market is fragile, though, in the aftermath of Covid and the rise of remote work, which drove down property values. In an op-ed last summer for the Harvard Business Review, one chief economist  warned  that banks with sizable CRE portfolios face exposure due to looming loan obligations and could fail, leading to a financial crisis. Placing hundreds of new buildings on the market, many in already struggling city centers, potentially risks further instability. Many of the federal buildings on the list of non-core real estate are fully occupied, sources tell WIRED. This includes buildings like the Senator Paul Simon Federal Building in Carbondale, Illinois, which houses offices for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Social Security Administration, in addition to offices for Durbin, as well as the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building in Detroit, Michigan, which also houses numerous agencies. The Trump administration has also touted a  return-to-office requiremen t as a key part of its planâsomething made more difficult if government employees donât have an office to return to. âThe GSA administration has moved quickly to cut regulation, reduce contract spin, and reduce lease square footage faster than any past administration that Iâm personally aware of,â Shedd said at the February 5 meeting. The Washington Post  reported  that these sales are intended to lower work morale to the point that employees voluntarily leave. Sources confirmed to WIRED that speed does appear to be a priority. âNormally the building disposal process involves a  public notice and response period , allowing local governments or nonprofits a first dibs, so to speak,â a source at GSA tells WIRED. âGiven the sheer number of potential disposals, it is unclear if GSA intends to follow the process established by law.â Makena Kelly and Tim Marchman contributed reporting.",

    "body": "At a  press conference in the Oval Office  this week, Elon Musk promised the actions of his so-called  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  project would be âmaximally transparent,â thanks to information posted to its website. At the time of his comment, the  DOGE website was empty . However, when the site finally came online Thursday morning, it turned out to be little more than a glorified feed of posts from the official DOGE account on Muskâs own X platform, raising new questions about Muskâs  conflicts of interest in running DOGE . DOGE.gov claims to be an âofficial website of the United States government,â but rather than giving detailed breakdowns of the cost savings and efficiencies Musk claims his project is making, the homepage of the site just replicated posts from the DOGE account on X. A WIRED review of the pageâs source code shows that the promotion of Muskâs own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the siteâs  canonical tags  direct search engines to x.com rather than DOGE.gov. A canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted. In DOGEâs case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on DOGE.gov, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X. âIt is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,â Declan Chidlow,  a web developer , tells WIRED. âThis isn't usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.â All the other US government websites WIRED checked used their own homepage in their canonical tags, including the official White House website. Additionally, when sharing the DOGE website on mobile devices, the source code creates a link to the DOGE X account rather than the website itself. âIt seems that the DOGE website is secondary, and they are prodding people in the direction of the X account everywhere they can,â Chidlow adds. Alongside the homepage feed of X posts, a section of Doge.gov labeled âSavingsâ now appears. So far the page is empty except for a single line that reads: âReceipts coming soon, no later than Valentine's day,â followed by  a heart emoji . A section entitled âWorkforceâ features some bar charts showing how many people work in each government agency, with the information coming from data gathered by the Office of Personnel Management in March 2024. A disclaimer at the bottom of the page reads: âThis is DOGE's effort to create a comprehensive, government-wide org chart. This is an enormous effort, and there are likely some errors or omissions. We will continue to strive for maximum accuracy over time.â Another section, entitled âRegulations,â features what DOGE calls the âUnconstitutionality Index,â which it describes as âthe number of agency rules created by unelected bureaucrats for each law passed by Congress in 2024.â The charts in this section are also based on data previously collected by US government agencies. Doge.gov also links to a Forbes article from last month that was written by Clyde Wayne Crews, a member of the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that pushed  climate change disinformation  and questioned the  links between tobacco and lung cancer . It is also a major advocate for  privatizing government departments . The site also features a âJoinâ page which allows prospective DOGE employees to apply for roles including âsoftware engineers, InfoSec engineers, and other technology professionals.â As well as requesting a Github account and rÃ©sumÃ©, the form asks visitors to âprovide 2-3 bullet points showcasing exceptional ability.â The website does not list a developer, but on Wednesday, web application security expert Sam Curry  outlined in a thread on X  how he was able to identify the developer of the site as DOGE employee Kyle Shutt. Curry claims he was able to link a Cloudflare account ID found in the siteâs source code to Shutt, who used the same account when developing  Muskâs America PAC  website. On Thursday,  Drop Site News  reported, citing sources within FEMA, that Shutt had gained access to the agencyâs proprietary software controlling payments. Earlier this week,  Business Insider reported  that Shutt, who recently worked at an AI interviewing software company, was listed as one of 30 people working for DOGE. Neither Shutt, DOGE, nor the White House responded to requests for comment.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-18 13:28:40",
    "body": "The National Science Foundation fired nearly 170 workers in a  Zoom  call on Tuesday morning as part of the Trump administrationâs agenda to reduce the federal workforce. The terminated workers, who were told their employment would end at 5 pm EST today, included those still under probation, but also workers who had already completed the requisite one-year probationary period to become permanent workers and at-will workers who were considered permanent employees. Earlier this month, however, these permanent workers were suddenly told by NSF that their one-year probationary period should have been two years and they were no longer safe from being terminated. The Trump administration has ordered federal agencies to  fire nearly all   probationary employees  who had not yet gained permanent status, thereby receiving civil service protections. But NSF workers who believed they were safe suddenly found themselves without jobs today. The National Science Foundation is an independent agency within the federal government that provides grants to universities and other bodies in support of scientific and engineering research. The foundationâs grants account for about a quarter of all federal support to academic institutions for research. NSFâs grants were paused in late January due to a funding freeze, but the agency  resumed issuing grants  following a court order early this month. Many of the people terminated on Tuesday work as program managers and experts who make decisions about funding by aligning research proposals with the right program and matching those proposals to the most qualified reviewers to assess them and make recommendations. âIt is hard to imagine this being accomplished successfully with automated algorithms,â one fired program manager told WIRED. âWith fewer program officers to steward the evaluation process, the overwhelming concern is that it will become harder to identify and support the transformative but unconventional projects that could otherwise be game changers in terms of advancing scientific progress in the USA.â All sources who spoke with WIRED requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Sources say 168 workers received an email at 9:02 am EST this morning requesting their presence at a 10 am Zoom call for a âMeeting with NSF probationary employees.â Many workers did not receive the Zoom link, however, and missed the start of the call. At the meeting, they were told that their network access would be shut out at 1 pm and they had until 5 pm to clear out their desks, though workers were told that accommodations would be made to obtain things they werenât able to clear out by 5 pm. The termination action this morning also included all permanent employees who were designated as âat-willâ workers. One terminated worker tells WIRED that they were a permanent federal employee working on a part-time basis, with an annual contract that was up for renewal in September. The decision to terminate at-will employees came from NSF alone, not from the administration, NSF management told workers during the meeting. When asked whether at-will employees were just terminated out of fairness to the probationary workers, NSF management replied that the decision was âpartly due to fairness, but thatâs not all.â The source says management then indicated that this was just the first step in subsequent termination rounds. The worker said they understood from this that the NSF believed at-will workers would be targeted in a subsequent round anyway, so they decided to terminate those workers now as well. The fired program manager who spoke with WIRED came to NSF from academia on a temporary rotation position. Rotationary workers are those who work for a university but spend some of their time working for the NSF for a specific period. When a permanent position suddenly opened up during the workerâs rotation, NSF asked the worker to apply for it. They were hired in the summer of 2023 as a program manager, with a one-year trial period that ended in the summer of 2024. Paperwork that the worker shared with WIRED showed that the worker became a permanent employee at that time. But the worker says they and others were suddenly told recently that NSF had made a mistake. During the Tuesday Zoom call, the worker says, staff from NSF human resources seemed to indicate they had been caught off guard by the decision. âThey were watching their words carefully,â the worker says. âMy sense is that they were caught unawares and probably somebody pointed to some federal statute somewhere that made them rethink how they had been doing things in the past.â The program manager says management and HR personnel told workers on the call that they believed the foundation had discretion to decide the probationary period but were recently told that the foundation did not have that discretion and that the probationary period should have been two years for all workers. Not everyone still on that probationary period got fired on Tuesday. The source tells WIRED that some workers who were very close to completing two years were not included in the terminations today. But workers were told that todayâs action was just the first in what will be other termination actions at the foundation. âThere were exceptions made for people who were very close to completing their two-year period,â the worker says. The temporary rotation worker and other workers at NSF were told in January that they could accept the so-called fork-in-the-road resignation deal that would allow them to continue to draw a salary through September if they resigned their positions, but the worker says that because he had completed his probationary period he believed his job was safe. Once they were told that the probationary period was in question, he says, he had only a couple of days to decide about the buyout, but the union had advised workers to not take it. Now he says his life and the lives of other workers have been thrown into chaos. The at-will worker says that during a question-and-answer portion of the Zoom call, several workers brought up the fact that federal agencies were supposed to condition the terminations based on merit, but this didnât seem to be happening. Workers have been receiving termination letters from the Office of Personnel Management saying that the government has determined they or their position no longer has value to the government. âThere were a number of employees who commented that they had nothing but exemplary performance reviews and director awards for meritorious services, so this notion that they were being let go [for poor performance] was ludicrous,â they said. âThe answer was that they were simply copying the verbiage from OPM and that their value to the nation is no longer required.â",

    "date": "2025-02-18 16:50:14",
    "body": "As Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency  rampages   through   the US government , its  access to sensitive data  is alarming federal agencies and Americans who interact with them. In the month since the Trump administration began its purge of federal workers, opponents fighting DOGE in court have been pinning their hopes of stopping the worldâs richest man on a 50-year-old law. In just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed  federal employee records  at the Office of Personnel Management,  government payment data  at the Department of the Treasury,  data on student loan recipients  at the Department of Education,  information on disaster victims  at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and vast amounts of  employment- and workplace-related data  at the Department of Labor. White House staffers are even pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to grant DOGE access to  US taxpayer records . The acting head of the Social Security Administration  recently resigned  rather than give DOGE access to her agencyâs reams of sensitive personal data. More than half a dozen lawsuits are seeking to block DOGE employees from rifling through these vast troves of data. One thing they all have in common: They allege that DOGEâs actions violate the Privacy Act of 1974. Hereâs how a law passed after Watergate could rein in another president whose self-professed zeal for retribution is unnerving constitutional experts. What Is the Privacy Act? The Privacy Act  is a law that limits how the federal government can collect, use, and share information about US citizens and other people in the United States. The lawâs core features include letting people  access government records about them ; letting people  correct those records  if they contain mistakes;  requiring agencies  to limit information collection, publish lists of records databases, and protect data from hackers; and  restricting how agency employees and third parties  can access records. Those restrictions on accessing data are at the heart of the ongoing DOGE saga. The Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing someoneâs recordsâeven within the agencyâunless that person approves in writing or the agency meets one of the lawâs 12 exceptions. Most of the exceptions deal with fairly specific circumstances, such as congressional oversight, law enforcement investigations, court orders, census work, statistical research, and National Archives preservation. But there are also two broad, vague exceptions: Agencies can share records with their own employees who â have a need  for the record in the performance of their dutiesâ or with third parties for â a routine use â (defined as one that is âcompatible with the purpose for which [the data] was collectedâ). Why Did Congress Pass the Privacy Act? President Richard Nixon illegally used the powers of the government to investigate, intimidate, and punish his political enemies. He  tried to use the IRS  to target liberal political groups with audits and scrutiny of their tax exemptions, and he  deployed the FBI  to spy on and harass his political opponents. After Nixonâs resignation over the Watergate scandal, lawmakers sought to prevent future presidents from weaponizing government power. âCongress must act before sophisticated new systems of information gathering and retention are developed, and before they produce widespread abuses,â North Carolina Democratic senator  Sam Ervin said  as he introduced one of the bills that inspired the Privacy Act. âThe peculiarity of new complex technologies is that once they go into operation, it is too late to correct our mistakes or supply our oversight.â After months of congressional wrangling that saw the elimination of Ervinâs proposed independent privacy oversight board, President Gerald Ford signed the Privacy Act into law on December 31, 1974. Ford, who had chaired the Domestic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy that Nixon created during his final months in office,  highlighted  âthe vital need to provide adequate and uniform privacy safeguards for the vast amounts of personal information collected, recorded, and used in our complex society.â How Is This Relevant Today? DOGEâs criticsâincluding Democratic lawmakers, federal employee unions, and government watchdog groupsâargue that giving the officeâs  young, controversial, and seemingly largely unvetted staffers  access to sensitive government data constitutes a major privacy breach. The incidents represent âthe largest and most consequential breach of personal information in US history,â  according to John Davisson , a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of the groups suing to block DOGEâs access. The Trump administration, meanwhile, says DOGE employees need this data access to accomplish their mission of eliminating wasteful spending and shuttering programs that conflict with President Donald Trumpâs agenda. After one federal judge temporarily blocked DOGEâs access to government payment systems, a White House spokesperson  called the ruling  âabsurd and judicial overreach.â  Musk targeted the judge  on X, saying, âHe needs to be impeached NOW!â Can the Privacy Act Stop DOGE? It will depend on whether multiple judges agree with the Trump administrationâs arguments claiming the law doesnât prevent DOGE staffers from accessing agenciesâ sensitive data. The government contends that people can only sue agencies under the Privacy Act in one of four scenarios: when an agency refuses to grant someone access to a record about them; when an agency refuses to modify someoneâs record as they requested; when an agency fails to keep someoneâs record up to date and they experience concrete harm, such as a denial of benefits; or when an agency otherwise violates the lawâs requirements in ways that adversely affect someone. It remains to be seen whether judges will determine that DOGEâs access to data adversely affects people. Agencies have also argued that they arenât violating the Privacy Act because DOGEâs activities fall under the lawâs âroutine useâ and âneed to knowâ exceptions. In  a court filing  responding to one legal challenge, the Treasury Department said that DOGE personnel were accessing the data to identify potentially improper payments âin furtherance of [their] dutiesâ as directed by Trump (triggering the âneed to knowâ exception) and that sharing this information with other agencies fell under one of the âroutine usesâ that the agency had previously disclosed as required by the Privacy Act. The strength of that argument rests on how judges weigh two questions: whether the DOGE personnel accessing each agencyâs data are employees of those agencies, and whether the two exceptions apply to the situations in which they accessed and shared the data. Whoâs Using the Privacy Act to Sue DOGE? There are at least eight lawsuits against the Trump administration over DOGEâs access to federal data, and all of them rely at least in part on the Privacy Act. The American Federation of Government Employees, the Association of Administrative Law Judges, and more than 100 current and former federal workers  are suing DOGE, Musk, and the Office of Personnel Management over what they claim is OPMâs illegal decision to give DOGE staffers access to a federal employee database, alleging that DOGE staffers âlack a lawful and legitimate need for such access.â The Electronic Privacy Information Center , on behalf of an unnamed federal worker, is suing OPM, DOGE, and the Department of the Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to OPMâs personal database and Treasuryâs payment system âfor purposes impermissible under the Privacy Act.â The University of California Student Association  is suing the Department of Education for allegedly turning over student data to DOGE staffers who are not, in the language of the Privacy Act, âemployees who have a need for the records in the performance of their duties.â Six government labor unions, two nonprofit groups, and the think tank Economic Policy Institute  are suing the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and DOGE to prevent the office from accessing a wide range of data, including federal workersâ wage-theft complaints and injury reports, for purposes allegedly âinconsistent with the Privacy Act.â Two government labor unions and the advocacy group Alliance for Retired Americans  are suing Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to Americansâ tax returns in alleged violation of both the Privacy Act and  the Internal Revenue Serviceâs own special rules . The National Treasury Employees Union  is suing Acting CFPB director Russell Vought for giving information about CFPB employees to DOGE staffers, alleging their status as âspecial government employeesâ places them outside the CFPB and thus outside the Privacy Actâs need-to-know exception. Nineteen state attorneys general  are suing Trump and Treasury over DOGEâs access to federal payment systems, arguing that because âmany of the DOGE members given access to [the system] were not employees of Treasury,â that constitutes âa violation of the Privacy Act.â Six Americans  are suing the Treasury and DOGE over what they describe as breaches of the sensitive personal data they gave the government while filing tax returns, applying for student loans, requesting disability payments, and receiving retirement benefits. Where Do These Cases Stand? In  the state AGs case ,  a judge quickly issued  a temporary restraining order restricting access to all Treasury systems storing sensitive personal and financial data. The case has since been assigned on a permanent basis to a different judge, who  adjusted the order slightly  after  the Trump administration objected  to its restrictions on political appointees. A status hearing took place on February 14. In  the EPIC case , the organization has  asked the judge  for a temporary restraining order blocking further DOGE access to certain Treasury and OPM systems. A status hearing will be held on February 21. In  the UC students case , the Department of Education  is arguing , among other things, that the students havenât shown any harm; that the Privacy Act only allows courts to pause agency actions in two situations not applicable here; and that the DOGE staffers are Education Department employees allowed to access the data. On February 17, a judge  denied the studentsâ motion  for a temporary restraining order, saying they had not suffered âirreparable injury.â In  the Labor, HHS, and CFPB case ,  the judge rejected  the plaintiffsâ request for a temporary restraining order, saying they failed to demonstrate the likely success of their arguments about the Privacy Act and other laws. But he also  questioned whether  DOGE staffers were employees of the agencies whose data they were accessingâa crucial question for a Privacy Act case. In  the Treasury case , the unions and ARA  have asked for  a temporary restraining order, but Treasury  is making  many of the same arguments as the Education Department, including that the Privacy Act canât be used to pause DOGE staffersâ access to data and invoking the need-to-know and routine-use exception. The judge in the case has  temporarily limited access  to Treasuryâs payment system while weighing the plaintiffsâ request for a restraining order. A hearing is scheduled for February 24. The  AFGE ,  NTEU , and  class-action  lawsuits havenât proceeded beyond the filing of initial complaints.",

    "body": "A Manhattan Federal Court judge on Friday extended the temporary restraining order that bars staffers from the so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  from  accessing US Treasury Department data âwhich attorneys general from New York and other blue states have slammed as an unlawful threat to privacyâwhile she considers whether to impose a longer-term injunction. After hearing some two hours of arguments, Judge Jeannette A. Vargas told lawyers for New York and allied states, and their opponents from the Department of Justice, âI do find good cause to extend the TRO as modified.â Vargas said she would soon issue her decision, but not today, to âgive the court time to considerâ the issues. While the proceeding largely maintained the status quo, it also lifted the veil on just how little is known about DOGEâs access to informationâand where it went. When Vargas asked Jeffrey Oestericher, the Justice Department attorney representing Trump, on Friday whether any DOGE-accessed information had been shared outside of the Treasury Department, he said: âThe short answer on that is we donât presently know.â âWeâre performing a forensic analysis. What we can tell from the forensic analysis thus far is there were emails sent outside Treasury,â Oestericher said. âWe do not know [the] content.â Vargas asked: Wasnât this problematic from a privacy standpoint? âThe short answer is no,â Oestericher said. âDuring this time that the DOGE team members had access to this information, there were extensive mitigation efforts in place to prevent this precise harm.â But Oestericher admitted at another point, âWe candidly admit that there was some measure of increased risk, but we took all appropriate mitigation measures to mitigate that risk as much as possible.â Vargasâ decision came six days after New York and allied litigants were granted a temporary restraining order that ultimately prohibited the Treasury Department from giving DOGE hires and special government employees access to sensitive data and computer systems. Donald Trump tapped Elon Musk to head  DOGE , an agency the president created under the auspices of rooting out fraud and governmental wasteâdespite a  dearth of evidence  indicating fraud. In issuing that temporary restraining order early February 8, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said that the states suing Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would âface irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.â Engelmayer noted that Treasuryâs new policy, enacted at Trumpâs direction, appears to allegedly â[expand] access to the paytment systems of the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) to political appointees and âspecial government employees.ââ This, Engelmayer reasoned, represented a ârisk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.â Engelmayer also said in his written decision that the states suing over Treasuryâs policy change âhave shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, with the Statesâ statutory claims presenting as particularly strong.â The complaint against Trump and Bessent repeatedly cited WIREDâs  reporting  that revealed how a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, with ties to Musk, enjoyed read and write access to two Treasury Department systems responsible for virtually all payments made by the federal government. Tom Krauseâwho is on the DOGE team  despite being CEO of Cloud Software Group âwas also granted access to these capabilities. Two sources told WIRED that Elezâs privileges allowed him not just to read but also write code for two of the most sensitive US government computer systems. These include the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). These systems, which are kept on a secure mainframe,  control government payments  that total more than 20 percent of the US economy, WIRED previously reported. In court papers filed February 13, New York and allies allege that Trump and his Treasury Department donât even contest that states have a âclear and reasonable interest in protecting their confidential bank account numbers and other sensitive financial information, including details and amounts of payments, from unauthorized disclosure.â But this information was disclosed to two DOGE members, they claim, violating ânumerous laws and regulations.â New York and other states argued in that same filing that BFSâs development of âmitigation strategiesâ to reduce risk was testament to the âsubstantial and imminentâ danger. They say that at least on one occasion, Elez was âmistakenly provided with âread/write permissions instead of read-only.ââ âBut even with the more restricted âread-onlyâ access, Elez still had âthe ability to view and query information and dataâ; in other words, he had access to the Statesâ sensitive financial information.â Despite the fact that Elez resigned when  asked for comment  by The Wall Street Journal about racist social media posts, the government didnât provide any reassurance that he didnât participate in improper activity, New York and its allies alleged. (Meanwhile, Musk  suggested  in a post on X, his social media platform, that Elez would be rehired, writing: âHe will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.â) Andrew Amer, an attorney in New York state attorney general Letitia Jamesâ office, said Friday that Elez and Krause âhave no lawful job duty to access this information.â Despite the governmentâs insistence that Elez was in a âsandbox environmentâ when he had access to the code, which they insist minimized risk, Amer said that wasnât all that comforting. âWe know that the same engineer took screenshots of the data in the data system and that he may have given those screenshots to his supervisor,â Amer said. Amer said the Justice Departmentâs insistence that Krause only had âover-the-shoulder accessâ didnât inspire much confidence either. âThe fact that we donât know if any information went beyond Treasury is a red flag that causes concern about the ethics issue,â Amer said. âThis is especially important, as we do have people, especially Mr. Krause, who is simultaneously employed elsewhere outside Treasury.â âYou have somebody whoâs been given access to source code within the bureau whose other job is CEO of one of the worldâs largest software companies.â âWe are here because the statesâ banking information has been accessedâ that has happened,â Amer said at another point in court. âWe know that the people who accessed it have been somewhat careless in the way they handled it.â Amer also rejected any notion that DOGE acolytesâ access was normal. âThis was not a Treasury function, this was building a new automated process to apply an ideological litmus test to funding requests. Thereâs nothing typical or normal in terms of Treasure functions about that.â Trumpâs camp has contended that his opponents are trying to thwart the White Houseâs right âto exercise politically accountable oversight of agency activities and to implement the presidentâs policy priorities.â Treasury Department officials are responsible for liaising with the United States DOGE Service, which needs to have access to BFS systems, they argue, âto perform their Presidentially-directed mandate of maximizing efficiency and productivity, including ensuring data and payment integrity with respect to the 1.2 billion transactions and over $5 trillion in outlays handled by BFS,â they said in court papers. Red states including Florida, Georgia, and Alabama have also entered the fray to show support for Trump. They contend in court papers that blue statesâ opposition to DOGE meddling is unconstitutional. âThis case involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers and the Presidentâs authority under Article II of the Constitution,â they wrote. âUltimately, Plaintiffs here are upset because one set of bureaucrats in the Executive Branch have access to data that they believe only other bureaucrats in the Executive Branch should have access to.â âThis type of fiddling around with the Presidentâs prerogatives asks this Court to insert itself into core Executive decision-making regarding policy and personnel. The President is working to combat what former President Bidenâs administration identified, at minimum, as hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud,â they wrote.",

    "body": "Engineers who work for  Elon Muskâs  SpaceX have been brought on as senior advisers to the acting administrator of the  Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA), sources tell WIRED. On Sunday, Sean Duffy, secretary of the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA,  announced  in a post on X that SpaceX engineers would be visiting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Virginia to take what he positioned as a tour. âThe safety of air travel is a nonpartisan matter,â Musk  replied . âSpaceX engineers will help make air travel safer.â By the time these posts were made, though, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, SpaceX engineers were already being onboarded at the agency under Schedule A, a  special authority  that allows government managers to âhire persons with disabilities without requiring them to compete for the job,â  according  to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These new hires come after the terminations of hundreds of FAA probationary employees, and the most deadly month of US  aviation   disasters  in more than a decade. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, none of the SpaceX engineers were fully vetted by their start date. Unlike the  very young technologists  associated with Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) who have been given access to critical systems at agencies ranging  from OPM  and the  Treasury Department  to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  in recent weeks, though, the engineers identified by WIREDâTed Malaska, Thomas Kiernan, Sam Smeal, and Brady Glantzâdo appear to have experience relevant to the FAA. Malaska is currently, according to his LinkedIn profile, a senior director of application software at SpaceX, where he started working in May 2021. Formerly the senior director of data engineering at Capitol One and a senior architect at FINRA, he graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2000 and cowrote a  2015 book  on Hadoop application architectures. Kiernan is currently a lead software engineer at SpaceX, according to his LinkedIn page. Before joining SpaceX in May 2020, he worked at Wayfair and is a 2017 Dartmouth graduate. Smeal is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since September 2021, according to his LinkedIn. He graduated from Saint Vincent College in 2018. Glantz is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since May 2024 and worked as an engineering analyst at Goldman Sachs from 2019 to 2021, according to his LinkedIn, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 2019. Malaska, Kiernan, Smeal, and Glantz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FAA also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Got a Tip?

In  his post on X , Duffy wrote, \"Because I know the media (and Hillary Clinton) will claim Elonâs team is getting special access, let me make clear that the @FAANews regularly gives tours of the command center to both media and companies.â But on Wednesday, FAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau wrote in an email to FAA staff, viewed by WIRED, that DOGE and the teams of special government employees deployed in federal agencies were âtop-of-mind,â before noting that the agency had \"recently welcomedâ a team of special government employees who had already toured some FAA facilities. âWe are asking for their help to engineer solutions while we keep the airspace open and safe,â he wrote, adding that the new employees had already visited the FAA Command Center and Potomac TRACON, a facility that controls the airspace around and provides air traffic control services to airports in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia areas. In a Department of Transportation all-hands meeting late last week, Duffy responded to a question about DOGE's role in national airspace matters, and without explicitly mentioning the new employees, suggested help was needed on reforming Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM) alerts, a critical system that distributes real-time data and warnings to pilots but which has had  significant outages , one as recently as  this month . âIf I can get ideas from really smart engineers on how we can fix it, Iâm going to take those ideas,â he said, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by WIRED. âGreat engineersâ might also work on airspace issues, he said. SpaceX functioned as the pre-inauguration staging ground for the DOGE team, according to reporting from  The New York Times  and sources who spoke to WIRED. In the months between November 5 and January 20, members of DOGE including Steve Davis (president of Muskâs Boring Company) and the young engineer Luke Farritor were operating out of the companyâs DC office, according to a source with knowledge. The company did not respond to questions about whether these employees will retain their salaries and positions at the company during their time with DOGE. Many of the so-called departmentâs operatives have joined as âspecial government employees,â who are limited to working 130 days in a year. Last week  WIRED reported  that Tom Krause, a DOGE operative at the Treasury Department, would continue to maintain his position as CEO of the Cloud Software Group while also performing the duties of fiscal assistant secretary. Other members of Muskâs companies, including xAI and Tesla, have also taken on positions with DOGE. Late last week, the  Trump administration laid off   400  FAA workers, according to Duffy. One union that represents some of these workers, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, says these included probationary employees who worked on aviation safety and maintenance. Air traffic controllers were not affected by the layoffs, Duffy  said in an X post . Just two weeks before that, the US suffered its most deadly aviation incident in more than a decade, when 67 people died after an Army helicopter  collided with a passenger jet  in Washington, DC. Though initial findings suggest  complex equipment and communications issues  possibly played roles in the disaster, President Trump was quick to blame âDEI,â railing against a decade-old program that helps the FAA identify talent among populations with disabilities. People with disabilities hired into the FAA and other federal agencies are often accepted under the Schedule A authorityâexactly the route these new engineers have taken into the agency. The FAA has frequently tangled with Muskâs SpaceX, as the rocket company and others fight to operate their own interests in crowded American airspace. In January, the FAA temporarily grounded SpaceXâs program after one of its Starship rockets broke apart midflight,  reportedly  damaging public property on Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean. The FAA diverted dozens of commercial airline flights following the explosion and announced an investigation into the incident, which is ongoing and being led by SpaceX. Musk, however,  characterized  the failure as âbarely a bump in the roadâ and  did not seem to indicate  that the investigation would slow SpaceXâs launch cadence. Last year, the company indicated it was aiming for  25 launches of the Starship in 2025 . FAA spokesperson Steven Kulm told WIRED that âthe FAA is overseeing the SpaceX-led mishap investigation.â The FAA did not respond to further questions about whether the presence of SpaceX engineers at the agency would constitute a conflict of interest. In September, the FAA  proposed   $633,000  in fines following two 2023 incidents in which SpaceX allegedly did not follow its license requirements, violating regulations. Responding to an X user posting about the penalties, Musk  wrote , âThe fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!â Shortly afterward, Musk called for FAA head Mike Whitaker  to resign . In January, more than three years before his term was due to end, Whitaker did resign. âI told Elon, any conflicts, you canât have anything to do with that,â said President Trump in a  press conference this week, in response to a question about Musk, SpaceX, the FAA, and conflicts of interest.  âSo anything to do with possibly even space, we wonât let Elon partake in that.â The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SpaceX is directly regulated by a small FAA agency called the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which since 1984 has licensed the launch of US space rockets. âThe purpose is to ensure public safety,â says George Nield, a former associate administrator of the office. âPeople on the ground did not consentâ to rocket launches above them, he says. âWe absolutely need to keep them safe. The office has done a great job of that.â The office oversaw 157 launches in 2024 alone. On February 10, several days after Musk  posted  on X that DOGE âwill aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,â a group of Democratic legislators  wrote  to Rocheleauâa career civil servant whose ties to the FAA go back to 1996ârequesting information about any planned changes to FAA systems. âWe are extremely concerned that an ad hoc team of individuals lacking any expertise, exposure, certifications, or knowledge of aviation operations being invited, or inserting themselves, to make ârapidâ changes to our nationâs air traffic systems,â they wrote. âAviation safety is not an area to âmove fast and break things.ââ Updated February 24, 2025, at 11:15 am EDT: This story was updated with a clarification of which employees were included in the recent layoffs.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have repeatedly affirmed Muskâs leadership of the so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE). But according to a new court filing from the White House, the administrator of DOGE isnât  Elon Musk  after all. Who is? No one knows. The White House wonât tell the public, an administration lawyer has reportedly  said  he had no idea, and even people who work for the US DOGE Service canât get a straight answer. On Monday evening, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House Office of Administration, claimed Musk wasnât actually in charge of the  so-called department  he has championed for months. Fisher issued a sworn statement in a lawsuit brought by the state of New Mexico and 13 other Democratic attorneys general accusing Musk of exercising authority beyond the scope of his role. Rather than serving as the DOGE administrator or an employee of DOGE at all, Fisher said, Muskâs formal role is âsenior advisorâ to the president with âno greater authority than other senior White House advisors.â This could make Muskâs authority and standing at USDS legally murkyâespecially as a  number of lawsuits  embroil the organizationâs activities. The statement has also compounded confusion at USDS, formerly called the US Digital Service and  rebranded as the US DOGE Service  on January 20. Multiple legacy USDS employees tell WIRED they have no idea who the acting administrator is, despite requesting their identity multiple times. Musk  announced that he would lead DOGE  shortly after Trump won the presidential election last year and has spent the weeks since Trump took office championing DOGEâs work on X, the media platform that he owns, and spreading  misinformation  about the role and expenditures of numerous government agencies targeted by DOGE. In a recent  Oval Office appearance , Trump referred to DOGE as Muskâs âteam.â If Musk is not serving as the administrator, his leadership appears to be unofficial and in name only. But this would leave it unclear who the official administrator actually isâor whether the office is vacant. This isnât a trivial matter. The executive order establishing DOGE plainly states, âThere shall be a USDS Administrator established in the Executive Office of the President who shall report to the White House Chief of Staff.â It goes on to say that an organization called the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization will be set up within the USDS, to be headed by the administrator and âdedicated to advancing the Presidentâs 18-month DOGE agenda.â According to Fisherâs statement, Musk has nothing to do with any of this. âThe U.S. DOGE Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The U.S. DOGE service Temporary Organization is within the U.S. DOGE Service. Both are separate from the White House Office,â Fisher wrote in his statement. âMr. Musk is an employee in the White House Office. He is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization. Mr. Musk is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator.â Before Trump was inaugurated, the USDS administrator was Mina Hsiang. After she left, Ted Carstensen was the highest-ranking legacy USDS leader, but  he resigned from the organization  on February 6. âAfter Ted resigned, we received no correspondence as far as who the head of this organization was,â says a current USDS employee, who requested anonymity due to concerns of retaliation. Some people WIRED spoke with at USDS view Amy Gleason, a former USDS official who served in the first Trump administration, as a liaison between legacy USDS, DOGE, and other agencies, but little is known about her official role. Steve Davis, a longtime Musk associate and the president of the Boring Company, is another name rumored to be formally leading DOGE. Davis has worked with Musk for years, and led the billionaireâs cost-cutting efforts when taking over Twitter, now X, in 2022. Davis went as far as  sleeping in the Twitter HQ  with his wife, Nicole Hollander, and their child. (Hollander is now a high-level General Services Administration official.) âSteve Davis has always been articulated as the leader of DOGE, but when I ask if heâs the administrator, [managers] say we don't know,â one former USDS employee tells WIRED. âWhen I ask if heâs the interim administrator, they say âwe don't know.â They've said Brad Smith [a health care entrepreneur with ties to Davis] is serving in a chief of staff role.â Got a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Meanwhile, as USDS staffers are trying to figure out who is running their agency, dozens of them have been laid off. Around 50 people out of USDSâs approximately 200 employees were fired on Friday. Sources tell WIRED that product managers, designers, and members of the talent team were hit the hardest, along with some engineers. âNo rhyme or reason. Literally in the middle of work,â another source said of the Friday night firings. âThere are so many of us.â âI have heard that our directors at USDS (legacy) still have not received any kind of list or justification for the intention to terminate emails sent Friday evening,â says another source at the agency. Last week, multiple agencies were rocked by sudden layoffs. Dozens of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees were fired  after receiving emails botching their names and roles . Later in the week, the entire CFPB team tasked with investigating big tech were terminated, a former CFPB official told WIRED. After the CFPB firings, other agencies, including the General Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, terminated thousands of workers. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment. While Muskâs DOGE workers have taken over at USDS for the last month, very few legacy employees have interacted with their new colleagues whatsoever. Earlier this month, WIRED reported that DOGE had built a  âfirewallâ  separating Muskâs team from the rest of the organizationâs workforce. The only time legacy staff had a meeting with a representative from DOGE was  on February 1 with Stephanie Holmes , who identified herself as the teamâs new HR person. The only other experiences legacy USDS staff have had with DOGE staff were  their surprise one-on-one interviews  with DOGE-affiliated engineers who refused to identify themselves during the first week of the Trump administration.",

    "body": "Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  put a $1 spending limit on most credit cards belonging to employees and contractors of the  General Services Administration âa critical agency that manages IT and office buildings for the US governmentâalong with at least three other federal agencies. Similar restrictions are expected to roll out to the entire government workforce soon, according to several sources familiar with the matter. âEffective immediately, all GSA SmartPay Travel and Purchase Cards issued to GSA employees and contractors are being paused and will not be available for use except in very limited circumstances,â GSA wrote in a memo to staff Thursday morning viewed by WIRED. The memo later stated that for âup to 0.1% of the GSA workforce, requests may be made for certain individual purchase charge card spend thresholds be set above $1. Please provide the rationale for all such deviations on an employee-by-employee basis along with the proposed increased threshold.â The GSA, one of the first agencies that  Musk allies infiltrated  after DOGE was established, manages the SmartPay program for more than 250 federal agencies and organizations. The SmartPay  website  claims it is âthe worldâs largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program.â The spending freeze comes after DOGE posted on X earlier this week that it was working to â simplify â the government credit card program and âreduce costs.â The restrictions immediately apply to GSA, the Office of Personnel Management, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and the  United States Agency for International Development , according to a source with direct knowledge of the project. All four of the agencies have been prominent targets of DOGE in recent weeks. Employees who spoke with WIRED say the changes will result in enormous complications to their existing workflows and that excessive or fraudulent spending is rare. Those whoâve already received approval for travel expenses (and may currently be traveling) have to request a temporary spending limit increase, the sources say. One important reason that federal employees typically put expenses on special government-issued credit cards is to ensure they avoid paying state sales tax on things like hotels and rental cars, which federal agencies are supposed to be exempt from. The GSAâs website states that the state sales tax exemption is â determined by method of payment ,â not by the employeeâs ability to prove they work for the federal government. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87. As DOGE attempts to cut billions of dollars from the federal budget, Elon Musk has been posting examples of alleged âfraudâ his team has uncovered to his over 218 million followers on X. In some cases, reporting from WIRED and  other outlets  suggests DOGE may be misinterpreting or misrepresenting what theyâve found. For example, Musk has falsely claimed that 150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits. Experts  told WIRED that  DOGE likely overlooked a quirk in the payments system that doles out these benefits, which automatically sets a personâs birthday to May 20, 1875 if the real date is unknown, making these individuals appear to be 150 in the system. The new spending restrictions apply to both SmartPay travel and purchase cards. Travel cards are widely used across the government (for example, most army reservists have these cards). The government tracks travel expenses, like hotel and airline fees, through software tools like Concur. The GSA already requires receipts for any purchase that its employees make over $75. âThe system is a pain in the ass and requires authorization from a supervisor before any money can be spent,â says a current GSA employee. Once a trip is done, employees have to submit a voucher that matches the approved expenses. Expenses are scrupulously trackedâemployees are told to minimize ATM withdrawals to avoid unnecessary fees, according to a current GSA employee, who like the others in this story, spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They say misusing a card is already grounds for disciplinary action, including termination. Purchase cards are more rare and are used for work expenses under $10,000; anything above this amount requires a formal government contract. Theyâre used for office supplies, IT equipment, and trainings, among other things. If employees want to spend money on a purchase card, they have to submit a form, which then needs to be approved and signed by a supervisor. When thatâs done, the form is submitted for approval to the approving office, with the name of the person who wants to make the purchase, a description of the item, the estimated price, an accounting code, and the date when the goods or services are needed. Once the payment is approved, itâs assigned a purchase request number. Only then can the employee actually spend money. If they spend 10 percent more than the approved amount, they need written approval again. At the GSA, each purchase is tracked through a program called Pegasys, which requires a separate form to access. Pegasys has two sides: The purchase side, which shows the money that was spent, and the reconciliation side. The card holder has to match these two sides, cent for cent, using the request number. âTo commit fraud, youâd have to have the employee, supervisor, and likely someone in finance in on it,â says another current GSA employee. âItâs not as easy as [DOGE is] claiming.â",

    "body": "The widespread layoff  of Department of Agriculture scientists has thrown vital research into disarray, according to former and current employees of the agency. Scientists hit by the layoffs were working on projects to improve crops, defend against pests and disease, and understand the climate impact of farming practices. The layoffs also threaten to undermine billions of taxpayer dollars paid to farmers to support conservation practices, experts warn. The USDA layoffs are part of the Trump administrationâs mass firing of federal employees, mainly targeting people who are in their probationary periods ahead of gaining full-time status, which for USDA scientists can be up to three years. The agency has not released exact firing figures, but they are estimated to include many hundreds of staff at critical scientific subagencies and a reported  3,400 employees  in the Forest Service. Employees were told of their firing in a blanket email sent on February 13 and seen by WIRED. âThe Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,â the email says. One laid-off employee described the weeks preceding the firing as âchaos,â as the USDA paused (in response  to orders from  the Trump administration) and then unpaused (in response to a court order) work connected to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)âthe landmark 2022 law passed under President Joe Biden that set aside large amounts of federal money for climate policies. âIt was just pause, unpause, pause, unpause. After four or five business days of that, Iâm thinking, I literally canât get anything done,â says the former employee, who worked on IRA-linked projects and asked to remain anonymous to protect them from retribution. The IRA provided the USDA with $300 million to help with the quantification of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This money was intended to support the $8.45 billion in farmer subsidies authorized in the IRA to be spent on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)âa plan to encourage farmers to take up  practices with potential environmental benefits , such as cover cropping and better waste storage. At least one contracted farming project funded by EQIP has been paused by the Trump administration,  Reuters reports . The $300 million was supposed to be used to establish an agricultural greenhouse gas network that could monitor the effectiveness of the kinds of conservation practices funded by EQIP and other multibillion-dollar conservation programs, says Emily Bass, associate director of federal policy, food, and agriculture at the environmental research center the Breakthrough Institute. This work was being carried out in part by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), two of the scientific sub-agencies hit heavily by the federal layoffs. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about whatâs happening? Weâd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mattreynolds.45 âThatâs a ton of taxpayer dollars, and the quantification work of ARS and NRCS is an essential part of measuring those programsâ actual impacts on emissions reductions,â says Bass. âStopping or hamstringing efforts midway is a huge waste of resources that have already been spent.â One current ARS scientist, who spoke to WIRED anonymously, as they were not authorized to talk to the press, claims that at their unit almost 40 percent of scientists have been fired along with multiple support staff. Many of their unitâs projects are now in disarray, the scientist says, including work that has been planned out in five-year cycles and requires close monitoring of plant specimens. âIn the short term we can keep that material alive, but we canât necessarily do that indefinitely if we donât have anybody on that project.â In a  press release , the USDA has said its plan is to âoptimize its workforce,â with this including ârelocating employees out of the National Capital region into our nationâs heartland to allow our rural communities to flourish.â But ARS units are located across the US, each one specializing in crops that are important to local farmers as well as bringing jobs to the region. âWeâve always been very popular in rural areas because the farmers and growers actually want what weâre doing,â says the ARS scientist. The USDA did not respond to WIREDâs request for comment. The hollowing-out of staff capacity will limit the USDAâs ability to implement IRA policies, says Bass, but it is not clear that this was the sole intention of the cuts. âThis seems to be a sledgehammer to the workforce in a way that will just roll back the number of folks on payroll,â she says. The purge could also indirectly hit farmers in red states, who are the main beneficiaries of proposals such as EQIP. âIt was necessary research to preserve our agricultural lands and fight climate change,â says one ARS employee who was fired last week after serving more than two years of their three-year-long probation. âCompared to the rest of the government, ARS is tiny,â they say. âBut we were able to get a lot done with relatively little money.â On her first full day in office, US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins told USDA staffers gathered at its headquarters in Washington that she supported the Department of Government Efficiencyâs attempt to optimize the USDA workforce. âI welcome DOGEâs efforts at USDA, because we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient,â she told the gathering. But Bass warns that blanket firing of USDA employees is hardly a pathway toward a more efficient agency. âThis approach of wide-swath firings throws the USDA and affiliated agricultural research enterprise into a world of uncertainty,â she says. âProjects that cannot be seen out to the end, cannot result in a peer-reviewed research paper or technical expertise being provided, are a waste of taxpayer dollars.â",

    "header": "What Elon Musk Got Wrong About Why Federal Retirement Is Still Managed out of a Limestone Mine",
    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-22 05:00:00",
    "body": "Elon Musk asserted last week that before any US federal employee  can retire , their paper records have to be processed more than 200 feet underground in an old limestone mine located in rural Pennsylvania, which he said often takes months. âAnd then the speedâthe limiting factor is the speedâat which the mine-shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal government,â Musk said,  standing next to  a seated President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. âAnd the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retireâdoesnât that sound crazy?â While Muskâs comment about elevator dependency is overstatedâthe mine has many entrances and exits, as well as a road leading in and out that golf carts and other vehicles can drive onâhis general point about inefficiencies within the federal retirement process is true. The  Office of Personnel Management , which functions as the human resources department of the US government, tells retirees to expect a  three- to five-month  wait to process their applications. And retirement paperwork for federal employees does route through a storage facility in a repurposed limestone mine in rural Boyers, about 50 miles north of Pittsburgh. When the system at Boyers was first established decades ago, putting retiree archives and processing files under one roof that was both remote and secure made a lot of sense. But over time, a systematic lack of resources, combined with repeated failed attempts to automate and digitize, created the â sinkhole of bureaucracy â that is the federal retirement hub today. Six years ago, the Government Accountability Office  reported  that the OPMâs retirement system was still plagued by a âcontinuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing.â The agency's average retirement file processing time was about 60 days in 2019, which is only a modest decrease from 1981, when it took  98 days , but the agency processed almost twice as many applications. But David Carmicheal, who recently retired as state archivist of Pennsylvania and has corresponded with staff at the Boyers facility, tells WIRED itâs a mistake to only view OPMâs process as âwoefully outdated.â âMuch of the work that goes on at Boyers, as I understand it, is digital, so the idea of people trundling piles of paper through dark mine shafts is absurd,â Carmicheal says. âIn fact, these facilities are meant to protect you and me by protecting the records that safeguard our legal rights, our public benefits.â When reached for comment, the Government Accountability Office referred WIRED to its most recent publications. The Office of Personnel Management did not respond to a request for comment. Going Underground The Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the OPM, started mailing retirement files to Boyers in 1960 with the intent to archive them â forever .â The CSC was one of many agencies that took advantage of repurposed mines and caves during the Cold War, seeking enhanced protection for sensitive materials in the event of a nuclear catastrophe. The Boyers mine was operational from 1902 to roughly 1959 under the helm of US Steel. When high operating costs and dwindling demand for limestone caused the business to decline in the 1950s, US Steel employee Larry Yont saw an opportunity to repurpose the site as a storage facility and, with the help of civil engineer and mine superintendent Russell Mitchell, went on to found National Underground Storage. It was later bought by the company Iron Mountain in 1998, which owns and leases the Boyers mine to this day. Along with the Civil Service Commission, other federal agencies, including the National Archives, the Office of Civil Defense (the precursor to the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and the Social Security Administration began storing records in the Boyers facility around the same time. J. G. Franz, then office manager of the Boyers mine, told a newspaper reporter in 1966 that federal agencies have âbackup equipment for everythingâ stored in a special area of Boyers to protect the records in the event of nuclear fallout. Franz told a local newspaper that workers âhope we will never have to worry about a nuclear explosion,â but that if one happened, the mine would be safely sealed off, according to newspaper archives reviewed by WIRED. âThe mine is equipped with a 30-day supply of food and supplies for all of the employees.â At the time, the staff at Boyers were reportedly able to process about 600 pounds of records each day bussed to the facility straight from Washington, DC. They relied on the recently constructed interstate highway system for timely deliveries. In fact, the federal government built an exit off Pennsylvaniaâs Interstate 80 specifically for âquick access to the mine in case of an emergency,â according to an article in the Pittsburgh Press. There are other practical benefits that make old mines a good place to store records. For one, their typically rural and secluded settings create a layer of natural security from other types of threats. Repurposed mines provide âexcellent fire protection,â and immunity from events like âflood, theft, civil disorder, aircraft crashes, tornadoes, lightning,â noted a  1999 Iron Mountain presentation  for the National Archives. Carmichael tells WIRED that access to the underground facilities heâs visited tend to be tightly controlled, often through heavily guarded entrances. These facilities also frequently have maze-like designs that would likely discourage or confuse thieves if they somehow got inside. Several current managers of repurposed limestone mines told WIRED that their caves are naturally between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, optimal temperature for most storage situations. John Smith, director of industrial real estate for the company that manages the limestone storage facility  Carefree Industrial Park  near Kansas City, Missouri, said that this means utility costs are âdramatically lowerâ compared to above-ground facilities. His main expenses are associated with ventilation, since caves tend to be very humid. It All Goes Wrong Shortly before the Civil Service Commission arrived at Boyers, the US federal retirement apparatus was a mess.  A 1951 government report  found that âan adequate record systemâ wasnât even in place yet and urged Congress to âinsistâ one be created. At first, it seemed like the team at Boyers was able to turn things around. The News-Herald reported in 1966 that with just 55 employees, the system at the mine was operating âwith the same efficiency and effectiveness as it used to in Washington, DC.â However, as the number of retirees continued to climb, things fell into disarray. By the early 1980s, the Office of Personnel Management was being audited to find the root causes of excessive delays in processing retirement claims. In 1981, the Government Accountability Office recommended that OPM âdevelop a long-term plan for automating the retirement claims process.â OPM tried to launch an automated system in 1987, only to shut it down in 1996 when it failed an independent review. It began planning a new system, but gave up in 2001 and decided to contract the work out. The contracts werenât awarded until 2006. The system they eventually built, RetireEZ, was finally launched in 2008, but it too was promptly shut down due to âquality issues.â Little progress was made until 2013, when OPM launched a new âstrategic visionâ for a totally âpaperless system.â Around that time, the agency was able to partially digitize the retirement process, allowing retirees to receive 80 percent of their pension quickly. But to get the full value, physical files still had to go through Boyers, according to a 2014  feature story  in The Washington Post. By 2019, the Government Accountability Office reported that OPM didnât have enough money to finish digitizing. The agency was then piloting what it called the Electronic Retirement Record system, which was supposed to replace hard copies altogether. As part of the improvements, OPM was also trying to fix âinconsistent data between electronic and paper records,â according to the Government Accountability Office. Boyers workers  would sometimes have to  track down the physical copies of records by navigating through what had become essentially a small city of shelves and files, or type up other files that werenât digitized. Despite all of these efforts, the OPM  still hasnât finished  digitizing the retirement process. Itâs been a decade since the agency updated its  internal guide  for processing retirement applications. The Government Accountability Office  attributed  the slow pace of progress to âthe continuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing,â lack of staffing, and OPM frequently receiving incomplete submissions. Musk and DOGE have  defunded  and  started to hollow out  a slew of government agencies. While the centibillionaire has identified Boyers as a prime example of government inefficiency, he hasnât described a clear vision for fixing the retirement system. Despite their shortcomings, Carmicheal tells WIRED that itâs important to remember why government bureaucracies and record-keeping systems were set up in the first place. âIâm just thankful that we have had a long history in this country of governments that care about protecting their citizens,â Carmichael says, âand that includes safeguarding the records that document our rights and the responsibility of governments toward us.â",

    "body": "Federal employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) were greeted this morning by television sets at the agencyâs Washington, DC, headquarters playing what appears to be an AI-generated video of President Donald Trump kissing the feet of Elon Musk, accompanied by the words âLONG LIVE THE REAL KING.â A person at HUD headquarters on Monday morning shared a video with WIRED showing the scene playing out on a loop on a TV screen inside the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building. The source, who was granted anonymity over fears of repercussions, says that workers at the building had to manually turn off each TV in order to stop the video playing. It is currently unclear who was behind the prank. Similar AI-generated videos and still images of Trump kissing Muskâs feet have been shared on social media platforms since last year. âAnother waste of taxpayer dollars and resources,â Kasey Lovett, a HUD spokesperson tells WIRED. âAppropriate action will be taken for all involved.â The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The incident came just days after leaked documents showed that  Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) project was planning to  eradicate 4,000 employees at the agency , which is in the midst of dealing with a US housing crisis. NPR reported  this weekend that HUDâs Office of Community Planning and Development is slated to lose 84 percent of its staff according to leaked documents. âWeâve decided internally to start notifying our granteesâevery mayor, county head, governor, nonprofit CEO, and congressional earmark recipientâthat they should anticipate a loss or significant unpredictable delay in funding,â a current HUD employee tells WIRED. Over the weekend, employees at HUD, like many other federal workers,  received an email from the Office of Personnel Management  demanding a reply with âapprox. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.â Leadership at many of the agencies, as well as federal workersâ union leaders,  told their members not to respond to the emails , while HUD leadership told employees to wait until at least noon on Monday before taking any action, a HUD source tells WIRED.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-21 06:30:00",
    "body": "This month, Andrew Bernier, a US Army Corps of Engineers researcher and a union leader, says that he has received a barrage of menacing messages from the same anonymous email account. Unfolding like short chapters in a dystopian novel, they have spoken of the genius of Elon Musk, referenced the power of the billionaireâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE), and foretold the downfall of âcorruptâ union bosses. But the most eerie thing about the emails, which Bernier says began arriving after he filed an official charge accusing the Trump administration of violating his unionâs collective bargaining agreement, is that they included personal details about his lifeâsome of which he believes might have come from surveillance of his work laptop. The author referenced Bernierâs union activities, nickname, job, travel details, and even the green notebook he regularly uses. The most recent email implied that his computer was loaded with spyware. âAndy's crusade, like so many before it, had been doomed from the start,â one email stated. âThe real tragedy wasn't his failureâit was his belief that the fight had ever been real.â The unsettling messages, which were reviewed by WIRED, are an extreme example of the kinds of encounters that workers across the US government say they have had with technology since President Donald Trump took office. WIRED spoke to current employees at 13 federal agencies for this story who expressed fears about potentially being monitored by software programs, some of which they described as unfamiliar. Others said that routine software updates and notifications, perhaps once readily glossed over, have taken on ominous new meanings. Several reported feeling anxious and hyperaware of the devices and technology around them. At the General Services Administration (GSA), one worker cited a Chrome browser extension called Dynatrace, an existing program for monitoring app performance. Inside the Social Security Administration, another employee pointed to Splunk, a long-standing tool thatâs used to alert IT staff to  security anomalies  like when an unauthorized USB drive is plugged into a laptop. At the US Agency for International Development, one worker was caught off guard by  Googleâs Gemini AI chatbot , installations of which  kicked off days before  Trump took office. âEveryone has been talking about whether our laptops are now able to listen to our conversations and track what we do,â says a current GSA employee, who like other workers in this story was granted anonymity because they didnât have authorization to speak and feared retaliation. Dynatrace and Splunk did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED. The workersâ accounts come as Muskâs DOGE organization is rapidly burrowing into various government agencies and departments, often gaining access to  personnel records ,  logs of financial transactions , and  other sensitive information  in the process. The efforts are part of the Trump administrationâs  broader plan  to terminate thousands of government employees and remake the face of federal agencies. Like many private companies, US federal agencies disclose to staff that they have tools to monitor what workers do on their computers and networks. The US governmentâs capabilities in this area have also expanded over the past decade. It couldnât be learned whether the Trump administration has begun using existing tools to monitor employees in new ways; multiple agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration, denied that they have. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Public evidence has not emerged of new government purchases of user-monitoring software, which is generally needed for detailed surveillance such as tracking which files a worker has copied onto a thumb drive. Some of the updates and changes that have been noticed by federal workers date back to software purchases and plans enacted long before Trump was in power, WIRED reporting shows. âI will say my concerns are primarily based in general fear as opposed to specific knowledge,â says a worker at the Department of Homeland Security, who adds: âIâd love to be told Iâm wrong.â But activity that some workers perceive as signs of increased surveillance has prompted them to take precautions. Bernier, who works as a civil engineer for the Army Corps based in Hanover, New Hampshire, says the messages he received spooked him enough that he asked local police to keep an eye on his home, removed the battery from his work-issued laptop, and kept his work phone on airplane mode while traveling to a nonwork conference last week. âThere are things I donât control but actions I can take to protect myself and my family,â he says. Bernierâs anonymous emailer and the Army Corps did not respond to requests for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at peard33.24, dell.3030, and alexadobrien.357. A person inside the Environmental Protection Agency told WIRED last week that theyâve witnessed coworkers back out of  Microsoft Teams  meetings, which can be easily recorded and automatically transcribed, when they are related to topics they believe could get them fired. âDefinite chilling effect,â the person says. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment. An employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose work with international partners is being  audited by DOGE operatives , says they and their colleagues began avoiding messaging one another and have âreally cut down on putting things in writingâ in recent weeks. They report that correspondence from their supervisors has also significantly dropped off. The NOAA declined to comment. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, anxiety around officials  possibly targeting  officers and activities perceived as being disloyal to the president has cratered morale, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the agents' concerns tells WIRED. The FBI declined to comment. Aryani Ong, a civil rights activist and cofounder of Asian American Federal Employees for Nondiscrimination, a group that advocates for government workers, says those sheâs been in contact with are in a heightened state of alert. In response, some federal employees have turned to encrypted communications apps to connect with colleagues and taken steps to anonymize their social media accounts, Ong says. (Federal workers  are granted an allowance  to use nonofficial communication tools only âin exceptional circumstances.â) Insider Threat Long before Trumpâs inauguration, user activity monitoring was already mandated for federal agencies and networks that handle classified informationâthe result of an  executive order  signed by President Barack Obama in the wake of a massive breach of  classified diplomatic cables and information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  in 2010. The capability is part of government-wide insider-threat programs that greatly expanded after  Edward Snowdenâs leak  of classified surveillance documents in 2013 and again after an Army specialist murdered three colleagues and injured 16 others at Fort Hood in 2014. The US governmentâs current approach to digitally monitoring federal workers has largely been guided by a  directive  issued by the Committee on National Security Systems in 2014, which orders relevant agencies to tie user activity to âspecific users.â The public portions of the document call for âevery executive branch department and agencyâ handling classified information to have capabilities to take screenshots, capture keystrokes, and intercept chats and email on employee devices. They are also instructed to deploy âfile shadowing,â meaning secretly producing facsimiles of every file a user edits or opens. The insider threat programs at departments such as  Health and Human Services ,  Transportation , and  Veterans Affairs , also have policies that protect unclassified government information, which enable them to monitor employeesâ clicks and communications, according to notices in the Federal Register, an official source of rulemaking documents. Policies for the  Department of the Interior , the  Internal Revenue Service , and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate , also allow collecting and assessing employeesâ social media content. These internal agency programs, overseen by a national task force led by the attorney general and director of national intelligence, aim to identify behaviors that may indicate the heightened risk of not only leaks and workplace violence, but also the âlossâ or \"degradation\" of a federal agencyâs â resources or capabilities .â Over 60 percent of insider-threat incidents in the federal sector involve fraud, such as stealing money or taking someone's personal information, and are non-espionage related, according to  analysis  by Carnegie Mellon researchers. â Fraud ,â âdisgruntlement,â â ideological challenges ,â â moral outrage ,â or discussion of moral concerns deemed âunrelated to work dutiesâ are some of the possible signs that a worker poses a threat, according to US government training literature. Of the 15 Cabinet-level departments such as energy, labor, and veterans affairs, at least nine had contracts as of late last year with suppliers such as Everfox and Dtex Systems that allowed for digitally monitoring of a portion of employees, according to  public spending data . Everfox declined to comment. Dtexâs Intercept software, which is used by multiple federal agencies, is one example of a newer class of programs that generate individual risk scores by analyzing anonymized metadata, such as which URLs workers are visiting and which files theyâre opening and printing out on their work devices, according to the company. When an agency wants to identify and further investigate someone with a high score, two people have to sign off in some versions of its tool, according to the company. Dtexâs software doesnât have to log keystrokes or scan the content of emails, calls, chats, or social media posts. But that isn't how things work broadly across the government, where employees are warned explicitly in  a recurring message  when they boot up their devices that they have \"no reasonable expectation of privacy\" in their communications or in any data stored or transmitted through government networks. The question remains if and to what extent DOGEâs operatives are relying on existing monitoring programs to carry out Trumpâs mission to rapidly  eliminate federal workers  that his administration views as unaligned with the presidentâs agenda or disloyal. Rajan Koo, the chief technology officer of Dtex tells WIRED that he hopes the Trump administration will adjust the governmentâs approach to monitoring. Events such as widespread layoffs coupled with a reliance on what Koo described as intrusive surveillance tools can stir up an environment in which workers feel disgruntled, he says. âYou can create a culture of reciprocal loyalty,â says Koo, or âthe perfect breeding ground for insider threats.â Already Overwhelmed Sources with knowledge of the US governmentâs insider-threat programs describe them as largely inefficient and labor intensive, requiring overstretched teams of analysts to manually pore through daily barrages of alerts that include many false positives. Multiple sources said that the systems are currently âoverwhelmed.â Any effort by the Trump administration to extend the reach of such tools or widen their parametersâto more closely surveil for perceived signs of insubordination or disloyalty to partisan fealties, for instanceâlikely would result in a significant spike in false positives that would take considerable time to comb through, according to the people familiar with the work. In  an email last month  seeking  federal employeesâ voluntary resignations , the Trump administration wrote that it wanted a âreliable, loyal, trustworthyâ workforce. Attempts to use insider-threat programs to enforce that vision could be met by a number of legal challenges. US intelligence community analysts are required  by law  and  directive  to provide unbiased and objective work. That means avoiding cherry-picking information to deliberately alter judgements or falling prey to outside pressure, including from personal or political biases. These standards, even when not officially codified, are core to the professional ethics of any  intelligence practitioner  or  law enforcement  analyst conducting assessments of insider threats. A 2018 national insider-threat task force  framework  notes that federal programs should comply with âall applicable legal, privacy and civil liberties rights, and whistleblower protections.â Bradley Moss, an attorney representing US intelligence and law enforcement personnel, says that \"disloyalty\" to the Trump administration is âtoo vagueâ an excuse to terminate employees with civil service protections, adding that if \"they're going to go through the statutory process, they need to demonstrate actual cause for termination.\" A federal law enforcement source warns that monitoring could theoretically be used to gather political intelligence on federal employees, while the administration looks for more palatable reasons to terminate them later; similar to how law enforcement may obtain evidence that's inadmissible in the course of a criminal investigation, but then search for  another evidentiary basis  to file charges. Joe Spielberger, senior legal counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan group fighting alleged corruption, says that if Musk were serious about cutting government waste, he would be strengthening  protections for people who report corruption and mismanagement . Any warrantless or mass surveillance of federal workers without transparent guidelines, he says, would represent a major concern. âWhen you create this culture of fear and intimidation and have that chilling effect of making people even more fearful about calling out wrongdoing, it ensures that corruption goes unnoticed and unaddressed,â Spielberger says.

    "body": "On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government  received an email  from the  Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), demanding a reply with âapprox. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.â On X, Elon Musk posted that failure to respond âwill be taken as a resignation.â The result? Confusion, chaos, and resentment among a federal workforce that increasingly feels  under attack . âSo fucking dumb,â says one air traffic controller who received the email and was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents ATC personnel, told its members not to respond until Federal Aviation Administration leadership provided guidance. Leaders of many agencies appear to have been caught off guard. At the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which houses the National Weather Service, some managers initially cautioned against replying to the email in case it was a phishing attempt. Another NOAA employee says they were cautioned not to log on to their work email after receiving it. Other workers were met with conflicting guidance from their managers. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is  anticipating deep cuts  orchestrated by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some employees reported being told to await further guidance while others say their managers instructed people to comply. The email appears to have been sent even to federal judges. âWe understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email from  HR@opm.gov ,â read an email from the directorâs office of the Department of Administrative Services for US Federal Courts. âPlease be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken.â At least some military personnel also received the email and have been told to await guidance from the Department of Defense. That holding pattern appears to be the response at most agencies, where workers say they have not heard from senior leadership if and how they should handle this latest escalation in  Musk and DOGEâs ongoing efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce . At the National Institutes of Health, for instance, in an email with the subject line âPlease Await Guidance,â some workers were told that âinformation is forthcoming,â without any indication of when or from whom. Another consideration for many is not only whether they should reply but how. While the OPM email specified that employees should not send classified information, links, or attachments, that severely limits how workers at many government agencies might be able to respond. âNational security staff are getting notified of OPMâs request, which is taking them from the important work of ensuring national security interests,â said one source, who was granted anonymity due to the nature of their work. âThese are essential employees who keep us safe.â âThe Executive Committee is currently reviewing this request to determine appropriate guidelines regarding what information can be shared outside of the agency,â reads an email from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which sits within the Treasury Department. âPlease wait for additional guidance.â NBC News  reported  Saturday that even  Kash Patel, the newly installed Federal Bureau of Investigation  director and close ally of President Donald Trump, has instructed employees not to respond to the OPM email. The State Department also told workers not to engage. âThe State Department will respond on behalf of the Department,â reads an email from leadership, viewed by WIRED and  first reported  by journalist Marisa Kabas of  the Handbasket . âNo employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64. This is not the first time that OPM, which operates as effectively the governmentâs human resources department and is  currently run by associates of Musk , has thrown the government into a state of alarm. In late January, OPM sent an email with the subject line âFork in the Road,â offering deferred resignation to anyone opposed to the new administrationâs return-to-office policy or stated desire for employees who are âreliableâ and âloyal.â That email was  strikingly similar to one that Musk sent  early in his Twitter takeover. Ultimately, according to White House figures, 75,000 emails took the deferred resignation offer; given annual turnover rates in the massive federal workforce, itâs likely that many if not most of those who took the offer were retiring or otherwise set to leave anyway. This latest email also closely resembles one that Musk  sent  to Twitter staff in June 2023. While Musk has publicly presented himself as responsible for the emailâand is the only source of the forced resignation threatâitâs unclear under what authority he would be able to fire federal employees at will over an email response. The White House has asserted in court documents that Musk is a âsenior advisorâ  rather than the administrator of DOGE  or otherwise in a position of real power. âLike other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,â the director of the White House Office of Administration  wrote  in a sworn statement.

    "body": "Four representatives of  Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force have been installed at the National Institutes of Health, according to multiple sources. WIRED reporting shows not only which DOGE members are at the NIH but also the sensitive financial system at least some of them have access to. Government records reviewed by WIRED show that the four people associated with DOGE have email addresses linking them to the NIH, the federal agency for health research in the US. Internal documents reviewed by WIRED show that three of these employees are employed in the department that controls the NIHâs central electronic business system, which includes finance, budget, procurement, a property-management system, and a grant-tracking system. The DOGE operatives listed in government records are Luke Farritor, Rachel Riley, Jeremy Lewin, and Clark Minor. Farritor is a former SpaceX intern and current Thiel fellow who also has a working email address linking him to the General Services Administration (GSA). Minor, a former engineer at Palantir, is, as has been  reported , the chief information officer of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Lewin is an agency lead at DOGE, according to  ProPublica ; he has a GSA email and has been named in  an affidavit related to a lawsuit  as having been involved in the gutting of the  US Agency for International Development . Riley works closely with Brad Smith, a former health care entrepreneur and DOGE leader prior to President Donald Trumpâs inauguration, according to  The New York Times . Internal documents list Farritor, Riley, and Minor as working under the umbrella of the NIH Business System Department. NBS is the central electronic business system of the NIH, according to the  agencyâs website . The NBS sits within the NIHâs  Office of Management , under the Office of the Director, and administers the core running of the NIH, including procurement, property management, data consolidation, and financial reporting. One NIH employee, who was granted anonymity as they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, referred to NBS as âNIHâs wallet.â Got a Tip? Are you a current NIH employee, or otherwise have insight into how DOGE is operating within the government? Weâd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter on Signal: mattreynolds.45 None of the DOGE-linked NIH employees responded to WIREDâs requests to comment. The NIH did not respond to WIREDâs request for comment. The NIH is the largest federal funder of biomedical research and a key sub-agency within HHSâthe government agency now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier in February the NIH dramatically slashed the funding it gives to universities, leaning heavily on a report by the Heritage Foundation that  railed against  the âmassive growth in DEI staff at US universities.â The NIH, which has a budget of $48 billion, has also frozen funding for applications for $1.5 billion in medical research, according to  NPR . DOGE workers, according to WIRED reporting, have effectively taken over key government agencies, including the  Office of Personnel Management  and the  GSA . On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government were left in confusion after  receiving an email from the OPM  demanding that they reply with âapprox 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.â The Trump administrationâs executive orders and policies have also wreaked havoc on domestic and international research. Cuts to USAID are helping to  fuel human trafficking  at scammer compounds and  have made it harder  for food aid to be delivered. Meanwhile, cuts at the US Department of Agriculture have derailed  vital climate and crop projects  intended to benefit farmers.",

    "body": "Consequences of the  United States rapidly  slashing  foreign aid are  reverberating  across the world, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an  unidentified illness  with Ebola-like symptoms has ravaged several villages. This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC. Experts say that Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiencyâs dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks. âMedical staff along the UgandaâDRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,â says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC. Nidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. âWe donât have the in-country presence,â she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. âOnce a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.â By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill. The US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. âCDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,â says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble. While the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization  now suspects  that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections  combined with malaria . Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  hypothesize  that this may be the case again. In 2024, the United States Congress  appropriated  $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections. Nevertheless, DOGE directed the swift dismantling of the vast majority of this aid. âHalting the US programs that prevent and treat malaria will lead to outbreaks and an exponential increase in deaths,â Martin Edlund, CEO of the nonprofit Malaria No More, said in  a statement . âNew  modeling  shows that a year of disruptions would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases of malaria and 107,000 additional deaths.â Whatever the cause of this particular outbreak of illness and death, the muzzled response stands in stark contrast to the critical assistance USAID would have provided had the outbreak occurred last year. Previously, the agency has also been a linchpin of the DRCâs overall public health responseâ according to  the US Embassy in Kinshasa, US health activities saved 11 million lives in 2024 alone âfor diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria.â Getting rid of USAID has demolished a pillar of international infectious disease response that will be difficult to replace, experts say, even if Trumpâs administration and  DOGE  were to decide tomorrow that lifesaving humanitarian aid with  minimal impact  on the federal budget and major  national security benefits  is worthwhile after all. USAID, established over 60 years ago, was slashed and burned in under two months. âYou canât rebuild a structure so quickly when you have fully burned it to the ground,â Bouri says. The breadth of the destruction of USAIDâs lifesaving work was underlined by the agencyâs acting assistant administrator for global health, Nicholas Enrich, in an internal memo viewed by WIRED and sent on February 28. (Enrich was  placed on leave  after issuing the memo.) âThe Bureau for Global Health has been wholly prevented from delivering life-saving activities under the waiver to date,â the memo says, describing in detail how the humanitarian waivers administered by the State Department have not worked in practice, and claiming that acting USAID head Pete Marocco refused to sign off on a plan to give the WHO previously agreed-upon access to âa critical stockpile of PPE and lab suppliesâ to support the current Ebola outbreak in Uganda. This confirms  earlier reporting  from WIRED about how the Ebola response remained botched despite Muskâs assertions that DOGE had âfixedâ mistakes it had made with Ebola personnel. Disease and illness do not yield to the concept of borders, and an outbreak in one country can easily become an outbreak in another. Covid-19, which originated in China, quickly impacted every nation. While hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola remain rare in the United States, one reason why the US has a national interest in monitoring and containing these and other illnesses is to guard against them spreading into the country. âThere are many places in the world which are prone to outbreaks where people can come to the US within one to two flights,â Bouri says. âIt does not take a long time for a virus to come in.â",

    "body": "On February 10,  employees at the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  received an email asking them to list every contract at the bureau and note whether or not it was âcriticalâ to the agency, as well as whether it contained any DEI components. This email was signed by Scott Langmack, who identified himself as a senior adviser to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Langmack, according to his LinkedIn, already has another job: Heâs the chief operating officer of Kukun, a property technology company that is, according to its  website , âon a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.â As is the case with other DOGE operativesâTom Krause, for example, is performing the duties of the fiscal assistant secretary at the Treasury while  holding down a day job as a software CEO  at a company with  millions in contracts with the Treasury âthis could potentially create a conflict of interest, especially given a specific aspect of his role: According to sources and government documents reviewed by WIRED, Langmack has application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside HUD, one of which contains records mapping billions of dollars in expenditures. Another DOGE operative WIRED has identified is Michael Mirski, who works for TCC Management, a Michigan-based company that owns and operates mobile home parks across the US, and graduated from the Wharton School in 2014. (In a  story  he wrote for the schoolâs website, he asserted that the most important thing he learned there was to âDevelop the infrastructure to collect data.â) According to the documents, he has write privileges onâmeaning he can input overall changes toâa system that controls who has access to HUD systems. Between them, records reviewed by WIRED show, the DOGE operatives have access to five different HUD systems. According to a HUD source with direct knowledge, this gives the DOGE operatives access to vast troves of data. These range from the individual identities of every single federal public housing voucher holder in the US, along with their financial information, to information on the hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily housing, and senior living facilities that HUD helps finance, as well as data on everything from homelessness rates to environmental and health hazards to federally insured mortgages. Put together, experts and HUD sources say, all of this could give someone with access unique insight into the US real estate market. Kukun did not respond to requests for comment about whether Langmack is drawing a salary while working at HUD or how long he will be with the department. A woman who answered the phone at TCC Management headquarters in Michigan but did not identify herself said Mirksi was \"on leave until July.\" In response to a request for comment about Langmackâs access to systems, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said, âDOGE and HUD are working as a team; to insinuate anything else is false. To further illustrate this unified mission, the secretary established a HUD DOGE taskforce.â In response to specific questions about Mirskiâs access to systems and background and qualifications, she said, âWe have notâand will notâcomment on individual personnel. We are focused on serving the American people and working as one team.â The property technology,  or proptech, market covers a wide range of companies offering products and services meant to, for example, automate tenant-landlord interactions, or expedite the home purchasing process. Kukun focuses on helping homeowners and real estate investors assess the return on investment theyâd get from renovating their properties and on predictive analytics that model where property values will rise in the future. Doing this kind of estimation requires the use of whatâs called an automated valuation model (AVM), a machine-learning model that predicts the prices or rents of certain properties. In April 2024,  Kukun was one of eight companies  selected to receive support from REACH, an accelerator run by the venture capital arm of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Last year NAR  agreed to a settlement  with Missouri homebuyers, who alleged that realtor fees and certain listing requirements were anticompetitive. âIf you can better predict than others how a certain neighborhood will develop, you can invest in that market,â says Fabian Braesemann, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Doing so requires data, access to which can make any machine-learning model more accurate and more monetizable. This is the crux of the potential conflict of interest: While it is unclear how Langmack and Mirski are using or interpreting it in their roles at HUD, what is clear is that they have access to a wide range of sensitive data. According to employees at HUD who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, there is currently a six-person DOGE team operating within the department. Four members are HUD employees whose tenures predate the current administration and have been assigned to the group; the others are Mirski and Langmack. The records reviewed by WIRED show that Mirski has been given read and write access to three different HUD systems, as well as read-only access to two more, while Langmack has been given read and write access to two of HUDâs core systems. A positive, from one sourceâs perspective, is the fact that the DOGE operatives have been given application-level access to the systems, rather than direct access to the databases themselves. In theory, this means that they can only interact with the data through user interfaces, rather than having direct access to the server, which could allow them to execute queries directly on the database or make unrestricted or irreparable changes. However, this source still sees dangers inherent in granting this level of access. âThere are probably a dozen-plus ways that [application-level] read/write access to WASS or LOCCS could be translated into the entire databases being exfiltrated,â they said. There is no specific reason to think that DOGE operatives have inappropriately moved dataâbut even the possibility cuts against standard security protocols that HUD sources say are typically in place. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18 or davidgilbert.01. LOCCS, or Line of Credit Control System, is the first system to which both DOGE operatives within HUD, according to the records reviewed by WIRED, have both read and write access. Essentially HUDâs banking system, LOCCS âhandles disbursement and cash management for the majority of HUD grant programs,â according to a  user guide . Billions of dollars flow through the system every year, funding everything from public housing to disaster reliefâsuch as rebuilding from the recent LA wildfiresâto food security programs and rent payments. The current balance in the LOCCS system, according to a record reviewed by WIRED, is over $100 billionâmoney Congress has approved for HUD projects but which has yet to be drawn down. Much of this money has been earmarked to cover disaster assistance and community development work, a source at the agency says. Normally, those who have access to LOCCS require additional processing and approvals to access the system, and most only have âreadâ access, department employees say. âRead/write is used for executing contracts and grants on the LOCCS side,â says one person. âIt normally has strict banking procedures around doing anything with funds. For instance, you usually need at least two people to approve any decisionsâsame as you would with bank tellers in a physical bank.â The second system to which documents indicate both DOGE operatives at HUD have both read and write access is the HUD Central Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS), an âintegrated management system for Section 8 programs under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public and Indian Housing,â  according  to HUD. (Section 8 is a federal program administered through local housing agencies that provides rental assistance, in the form of vouchers, to  millions of lower-income families .) This system was a precursor to LOCCS and is currently being phased out, but it is still being used to process the payment of housing vouchers and contains huge amounts of personal information. There are currently  2.3 million families in receipt of housing vouchers  in the US, according to HUDâs own data, but the HUDCAPS database contains information on significantly more individuals because historical data is retained, says a source familiar with the system. People applying for HUD programs like housing vouchers have to submit sensitive personal information, including medical records and personal narratives. âPeople entrust these stories to HUD,â the source says. âItâs not data in these systems, itâs operational trust.â WASS, or the  Web Access Security Subsystem , is the third system to which DOGE has both read and write access, though only Mirski has access to this system according to documents reviewed by WIRED. Itâs used to grant permissions to other HUD systems. âMost of the functionality in WASS consists of looking up information stored in various tables to tell the security subsystem who you are, where you can go, and what you can do when you get there,â a  user manual  says. âWASS is an application for provisioning rights to most if not all other HUD systems,â says a HUD source familiar with the systems who is shocked by Mirskiâs level of access, because normally HUD employees donât have read access, let alone write access. âWASS is the system for setting permissions for all of the other systems.â In addition to these three systems, documents show that Mirski has read-only access to two others. One, the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS), is a nationwide database that tracks all HUD programs underway across the country. (âIDIS has confidential data about hidden locations of domestic violence shelters,â a HUD source says, âso even read access in there is horrible.â) The other is the Financial Assessment of Public Housing (FASS-PH), a database designed to âmeasure the financial condition of public housing agencies and assess their ability to provide safe and decent housing,â according to HUDâs website. All of this  is significant because, in addition to the potential for privacy violations, knowing what is in the records, or even having access to them, presents a serious potential conflict of interest. âThere are often bids to contract any development projects,â says Erin McElroy, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. âI can imagine having insider information definitely benefiting the private market, or those who will move back into the private market,â she alleges. HUD has an oversight role in the mobile home space, the area on which TCC Management, which appears to have recently wiped its website, focuses. \"Itâs been a growing area of HUDâs work and focus over the past few decades,\" says one source there; this includes setting building standards, inspecting factories, and taking in complaints. This presents another potential conflict of interest. Braesemann says itâs not just the insider access to information and data that could be a potential problem, but that people coming from the private sector may not understand the point of HUD programs. Something like Section 8 housing, he notes, could be perceived as not working in alignment with market forcesââBecause there might be higher real estate value, these people should be displaced and go somewhere elseââeven though its purpose is specifically to buffer against the market. Like other government agencies, HUD is facing mass purges of its workforce. NPR has  reported  that 84 percent of the staff of the Office of Community Planning and Development, which supports homeless people, faces termination, while the president of a union representing HUD workers has  estimated  that up to half the workforce could be cut The chapter on housing policy in Project 2025âthe right-wing playbook to remake the federal government that the Trump administration appears to be followingâoutlines plans to massively scale back HUD programs like  public housing, housing assistance vouchers, and first-time home buyer assistance .

    "body": "When  President Donald Trumpâs  aides and advisers relay concerns about Elon Musk's  takeover  of the federal government, they're often given what's intended to be a reassuring answer: Don't worry, Stephen and Katie Miller will take care of it. As Musk and his so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) task force dismantle  key parts of the government  and plan to cut the workforce at federal agencies by half or more, the Millers have become pivotal figures in Muskâs orbit, multiple sources tell WIRED. The couple has been tasked as intermediaries, bringing news about Muskâs latest targets and communications strategies to the rest of the White House, say members of Trumpâs inner circle and people outside the administration who know them personally. Just over a month into the new administration, they have been privately projecting themselves as two pairs of steady hands at the till. Stephen Miller is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser; two sources described his current role as that of a prime minister. His wife, Katie Miller, is a special government employee who functions as the top communications official at DOGE. She is also on the payroll of the firm P2 Public Affairs,  The Wall Street Journal  reported, which has ties to Musk and several alumni of Florida governor Ron DeSantisâ 2024 presidential campaign. Stephen was a senior adviser in Trumpâs first term, and an  architect  of the administrationâs anti-immigration platform, including  advocating fo r the policy of separating migrant children from their families. Katie served in the first Trump administration as deputy press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security during Kirstjen Nielsenâs tenure before ascending to the role of press secretary in 2019 and communications director in 2020 for then-vice president Mike Pence. The Millers were married in 2020. Katie Miller, like many people associated with DOGE, is, as a special government employee, limited to working in the federal government for no more than 130 days in any given 365-day period and subject to less stringent ethics requirements than permanent employees. She was assigned to run communications for Musk prior to the transition, a White House official tells WIRED, beginning her journey with Musk as a âcomms sherpa.â Now she has become the richest man in the worldâs guide to life in Washington and integral to the high-velocity, high-volume barrage of cuts to the governmentâs workforce and spendingâmany of them being questioned in the courts as to their legalityâthat have come to dominate Trumpâs first month back in office. Her relationship with Musk, the White House official says, is central to DOGEâs interactions with the rest of the White House. Sheâs the key intermediary, delivering the DOGE message of the day to the rest of the administration. Sheâs also the one to deliver any sensitive or bad news to Musk, says the official. The Republicans who spoke to WIRED for this story all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. They are all generally supportive of the DOGE initiatives but share varying degrees of concern about Musk harming Trumpâs image and felt compelled to speak up out of an urge to protect the boss. (Trump, meanwhile, has continued to back Musk publicly with enthusiastic praise for DOGEâs cuts, most recently with a flattering introduction before Musk held court at Wednesdayâs cabinet meeting.) Meanwhile, Stephen Miller has, along with Project 2025 coauthor and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, became one of  Muskâs closest allies  in the administration, The New York Times reported earlier this month. WIRED has learned that the relationship is far closer, and more complicated, than has been previously known publicly. In many ways, Muskâs targeting of federal agencies is perfectly in sync with the aims of Miller, who has championed DOGEâs work internally and even helped in making a lot of it possible. (In public, Miller has  equated  federal workers with âradical left Communistsâ and âcriminal cartels.â) Still, sources tell WIRED that Trumpworld is more comfortable with Musk taking the heat for the recent federal cuts rather than the less famousâand, in their view, far less telegenicâMiller. Yet through their actions so far, the Millers and Musk have developed a MAGA version of the Pet Shop Boys adage from the song âOpportunities (Letâs Make Lots of Money)â:  Youâve got the brawn / Iâve got the brains.  Stephen Millerâs knowledge of the federal apparatus, Katie Millerâs contacts on Capitol Hill, and the coupleâs good standing among Trump loyalists, coupled with Muskâs relentless ambition and effectively infinite resources, made the scale of the DOGE government takeover possible. Musk is not the independent actor heâs often portrayed as and taken to be, in other words, but is rather carrying out actions essentially in concert with the man to whom the president has delegated much of the day-to-day work of governance. âStephen is kind of the prime minister,â one of three Republicans close to Trump and familiar with the situation tells WIRED. Another Republican familiar with the dynamic also used the term âPMâ to describe Miller, short for prime minister. The implication is that Miller is carrying out the daily work of governance while Trump serves as head of state, focusing on the fun parts of being president. The White House did not answer questions about who reports to or outranks whom. The Millers are seen inside Trumpworld as glorified babysitters for Musk, tasked with ensuring he stays within bounds, insofar as thatâs possible. âHe gets a lot of grace,â the first Republican said of Musk. âMany people arenât nervous, because Stephen Miller is deeply involved. And Katie.â This Republican compared Musk to a preteen child. The involvement of the Millers is also one of the many reasons why Trumpworld sources say they now donât currently see an implosion between Trump and Musk happening anytime soon even though, as  WIRED previously reported, rifts have already emerged  within the presidentâs inner circle over the centibillionaireâs level of power. Still, Muskâs relationship with the Millers has become a subject of great intrigue in Washington as DOGE continues to wreak havoc on the federal government. Little is known about how often they interact outside of work and how the relationship grew over the late stages of the campaign into the transition. âIf you can find out anything about Stephen Millerâs social life, I donât wanna know the answer,â says a longtime Republican operative who knows the couple personally. âStephen and Katie are very attentive to [Musk],â the Republican who referred to Stephen as âprime ministerâ tells WIRED. Thereâs also only one audience which truly matters, they say: âHeâs got a forgiving audience: the audience of one, and all of us around him.â",

    "body": "Guests are paying millions of dollars to dine and meet with  President Donald Trump  at special events held at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Business leaders can secure a one-on-one meeting with the president at Mar-a-Lago for $5 million, according to sources with direct knowledge of the meetings. At a so-called candlelight dinner held as recently as this past Saturday, prospective Mar-a-Lago guests were asked to spend $1 million to reserve a seat, according to an invitation obtained by WIRED. âYou are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest President Donald J. Trump,â the invitation reads, under a âMAGA INC.â header. MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trumpâs 2024 presidential campaign. âAdditional details provided upon RSVP. RSVPs will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis. Space is very limited. $1,000,000 per person.â Invitees were asked to RSVP to Meredith OâRourke, who served as national finance director and senior adviser at Donald J. Trump for President 2024, a campaign committee, and who is the owner of The OâRourke Group, which OâRourke describes on her LinkedIn page as a âRepublican political fundraiser.â Invitees were also directed to email Abby Mathis, the finance coordinator at MAGA Inc. Mathis was previously a staff assistant for Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabamaâa former Auburn University football coachâand also served as an intern at the White House office of the staff secretary, according to LegiStorm, a research organization that posts information on politicians and their staffers. OâRourke and Mathis did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. The invitation specifically states that âDonald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a featured speaker, and is not asking for funds or donations.â The event occurred at 7 pm on March 1 and was listed on the  presidentâs official schedule  as the âMAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.â This is the only event by that name on Trumpâs official schedule since he took office. Michael Solakiewicz, a pro-Trump digital creator, posted photographs of the event on Instagram. WIRED has also viewed photographs and videos of  Elon Musk  with his son X at Mar-a-Lago the following day during a  charity event  hosted by a group called Wine Women & Shoes that also featured Trump.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, louise_matsakis.83, and Leak2Lahut.26. âItâs everyone else who missed the boat,â a Trumpworld source with knowledge of the meetings says, referring to latecomers to the Trump agenda. The source pointed specifically to the tech sector, where executives have scrambled to show fealty to the new administration. While X owner Elon Musk notably spent at least  $260 million  to elect Trump, other tech  companies  and  executives  collectively donated millions to Trumpâs inauguration fund: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos, Meta, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Uber, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all donated $1 million each. The $5 million one-on-one meetings have become a âhot ticketâ in the business community, says a source familiar with them. Itâs unclear where the money is going and what it will be used for, but one source with direct knowledge of the dinners said âitâs all going to the library,â as in the presidential library that will ostensibly be built once Trump leaves office. MAGA Inc  spent over  $450 million to elect Trump in 2024, though Trump is not legally permitted to run for a third presidential term in 2028. So-called candlelight dinners offering access to the president are known to have been held prior to Trumpâs inauguration, but have not previously been reported to have occurred while he is in office. (Trump did, however, appear at a  number  of other  fundraising  events during his first term.) Most recently,  The Washington Post  reported that such candlelight dinners were held on December 19 and January 19âthe night before Trumpâs presidential inaugurationâfor the cost of $1 million per attendee.  Ivanka Trump  and Jared Kushner attended the January 19 event. In the lead-up to Trumpâs 2016 inauguration, donors who spent seven figures could secure eight tickets to a candlelight dinner, according to a Washington Post  report  at the time. While previous second-term presidents have held fundraisers for their parties, the nature, timing, location, and price tag of Trumpâs dinner all raise flags for experts. âI canât recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,â says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. âThe concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence â¦ People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.â âPart of what is worrying,â Moynihan adds, âis the lack of ethical guardrails in the current Trump administration, where there doesnât seem to be a clear line between Trumpâs businesses and the presidency.â",

    "body": "In 2008, the US Embassy in Beijing started regularly tweeting about the  air quality  in the city, which was gearing up to host Chinaâs first Olympic Games. Two times a day, the embassy automatically published current  pollution levels  measured by an air quality monitor installed on its roof in collaboration with the US Environmental Protection Agency. The data contradicted the figures published by the local government, angering local officials and eventually spurring China to clean up the air in its capital city. But on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the US State Department told WIRED that the program is abruptly ending due to budget constraints. The project eventually became part of a broader, highly successful US government initiative known officially as DOSAir, which measured pollution levels in about 80 cities where US diplomatic missions are located around the world. Scientists and researchers have credited it with helping clean up the air in dozens of countries, preventing up to 895 premature deaths and saving $465 million in medical costs per median city annually, according to  a research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2022 . For now, individual embassies can still run their air monitors, the State Department spokesperson said, but they will no longer send data back to the agency. Historical statistics will continue to be available online, but thereâs no estimated date when real-time data transmissions will resume, they added. âIn many countries where these instruments were placed, it was the first air quality data ever,â says Daniel Westervelt, a research professor at Columbia Universityâs Climate Schoolâs Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. âThat going away is going to hinder research and hinder the advancement of our understanding of the exposure of air pollutants to human health.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former US government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zeyiyang.06. Sixteen years ago, when the US embassy began sharing air quality data in Beijing, Twitter had not yet been blocked in China. Graham Webster, a research scholar at Stanford who lived in the country at the time, remembers seeing tweets from the US Embassy occasionally go viral when its pollution monitoring bot designated the air quality in the city as âcrazy bad,â indicating a hazardous pollutant known as PM2.5 had reached extremely high levels. The State Department program soon became a source for data that challenged the official air quality reports released by the Chinese government. âIt allowed the Chinese public to view a comparison between the outside observers and the official statistics,â Webster says. âI think itâs an example of how good, quality data that people trust can make things difficult for a political regime where information is tightly controlled.â At first, the local government in Beijing fervently opposed the initiative. At one point, the Chinese deputy minister of environmental protection  publicly called  the American air quality readings unlawful and  said  the US was âintervening in China's domestic affairs.â But even though Beijing officials publicly opposed it, a former US diplomat who ran the air quality monitoring program in its early years tells WIRED that many of them expressed appreciation for the program behind closed doors, because it gave them information they could use to protect their own health, too. (They asked to remain anonymous because they werenât authorized to speak to the media.) The State Departmentâs air quality program eventually became an example of a smart, efficient diplomacy that boosted American soft power while bringing about real-world changes. âIâve never seen an initiative of the US government have such an immediate, dramatic impact in a country,â Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China, told the Washington Post back in 2013. The project was so successful that it was featured on the website of  the National Museum of American Diplomacy . Before it was suddenly killed, State Department officials, researchers, and the public could view the international air quality data collected from US embassies on AirNow, a database maintained by the EPA, as well as on ZephAir, an app designed by the State Department to help US diplomats abroad. The  former webpage  has been made unavailable; the app showed that at least half a dozen embassies stopped reporting regular data in the middle of Tuesday before the function was completely disabled on Wednesday, according to tests performed by WIRED. Westervelt, who describes the DOSAir as âa bedrock of international air quality work,â says he previously received grants from the State Department to help expand the program in Africa. He says he became worried about its fate when he learned last week that his grants had been terminated along with  thousands of others  at the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development. Diplomatic Triumph By the end of 2011, the air monitoring program was having its big moment of public recognition in China. Pollution got so bad in Beijing that the city had to close its airport. The State Departmentâs bot was blasting âcrazy badâ readings on Twitter again, but the official Chinese government figures said the air was only âslightly polluted.â The Chinese public, however, decided to trust the US embassyâs number. Many people voiced their disappointment on social media and pushed the government to take action to clean up the air. It became âan environmental awakening akin to the London Fog,â says the former US diplomat. In a twist thatâs almost incomprehensible today, the Chinese government even officially adopted the US State Departmentâs method for reporting air quality. It also made significant efforts to clean up air pollution, and collaborated with the EPA on climate and environmental issues. The DOSAir program was welcomed in many other countries as well, especially those that didnât have an existing infrastructure to collect air quality data, says Westervelt. In some cases, local governments used the high-quality data collected at US embassies to calibrate readings on their own lower-cost air monitors. For these countries, ending support for the air quality monitoring program could hinder their progress cleaning up the air, says Westervelt. âYou canât really mitigate the air pollution problem unless you have quantitative evidence,â he explains. âLosing it is a pretty big blow.â Clear Economic Winner Over the past month, the Trump administration has slashed funding and staff across the federal government as part of a  cost-cutting initiative  led by Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But the air quality monitoring program isnât very expensive for the US State Department to maintain. Westervelt estimates it costs just tens of thousands of dollars a year because most of the monitoring equipment has already been purchased, and the main expenses are associated with maintenance. The program demonstrated how relatively low-cost information technologies could be used to spur substantial reductions of air pollution, says Akshaya Jha, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who co-authored the 2022 study. When a US embassy began publishing the readings in a city, he says, it often raised public awareness about pollution and put pressure on the host country to take action to clean up the air. Jha found that local Google searches for the term âair qualityâ steadily increased after monitors were installed. Air pollution levels, estimated by satellite measurements, also dropped. In the long run, Jhaâs research also found that the program actually saves money for the State Department, which is required to pay diplomats extra compensation for living in more hazardous environments. âOur estimates indicate that the monitors save the median embassy roughly $34,000 a year in this kind of hardship payments,â Jha says. Even beyond the hardship compensation, creating a world where fewer people are dying from diseases linked to air pollution would reduce the need for things like costly medical treatments. âIn terms of benefits of this program relative to its costs, Itâs a clear winner,â Jha says.",

    "body": "Representatives from dozens  of nonprofit organizations attending a major human rights conference in Taipei, Taiwan, last week woke up Thursday to devastating news. Over the previous night in Asia, the Donald Trump administration had abruptly announced it would end nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from the US State Department, including the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) as well as the  US Agency for International Development , representing about  90 percent  of USAIDâs contracts overall. The announcement was the latest in a string of efforts by the Trump administration and Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to curtail foreign aid from the US, which has provided medical and humanitarian assistance to millions of people for decades. A letter sent from USAID to grantees viewed by WIRED instructed them to âimmediately cease all activities, terminate all subawards and contracts,â and avoid incurring any additional expenses âbeyond those unavoidable costs associated with this Termination Notice.â Several digital and human rights organizations who spoke to WIRED in Taipeiâmost on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the Trump administration or their own governmentsâsay the cuts have undermined years of global democracy-building and free speech initiatives and put the lives and livelihoods of their staff around the world at risk. Many of the groups who were at RightsCon, one of the largest annual events centered on human rights and technology organized by the nonprofit Access Now, particularly focus on providing cybersecurity support for people like journalists, activists, and other vulnerable groups in authoritarian countries, like protecting against doxxing and hacking attacks meant to intimidate and silence them. Without USAID and State Department funding, that work will likely cease. âThe digital security ecosystem has collapsed totally for NGOs, totally,â says Mohammed Al-Maskati, director of Access Nowâs digital security helpline, which offers free digital security help to journalists, activists, and civil society groups. Causing even further confusion, just days after the cancellations went out some organizations say they received notices that they were sent in error, according to correspondence reviewed by WIRED. Itâs not clear how the Trump administration determined which grants and organizations would be spared. Nonprofit organizations that can keep their funding from the US government, however, will be subject to a new requirement: Their contracts now include a rider mandating they comply with an  anti-DEI executive order  that Trump signed in late January. It applies to all of an organizationâs programs, even if they donât all receive American support. Failure to follow the order may constitute a violation of the  false claims act , the Trump administration warned in materials reviewed by WIRED. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82. When WIRED initially reached out about the cancellations, a State Department representative said that âeach program underwent a review with the goal of restructuring assistance to align with the administration's policy priorities. Programs that serve our nationâs interests will continue. However, programs that arenât aligned with our national interest will not.â The State Department did not respond to follow-up questions about the reinstatement of certain grants. USAID did not respond to requests for comment. In a  post on X  on Monday, Musk asserted that âno one has died as result of a brief pause to do a sanity check on foreign aid funding. No one.â He categorized DOGEâs work at the aid agency far more dramatically last month, boasting about having spent one weekend â feeding USAID into the wood chipper .â One nonprofit worker whose organization supports projects in Asia says they were bewildered by the kinds of initiatives that were initially canceled at their organization, which were focused on helping groups resisting Chinaâs authoritarian influence. That person told WIRED that the State Department representatives they were in contact with also seemed to be taken by surprise by the sudden revocation of the grants, some of which were later reversed. âThings are total chaos now,â the nonprofit worker says. A person familiar with US-funded projects in Venezuela that are designed to help people access news and information  censored  by the country's authoritarian ruler NicolÃ¡s Maduro says the funding cuts will render that work useless. âNow, all that money that was already spent in building these things will have gone to waste,â the person tells WIRED. Leaders in the Trump administration have harshly criticized the Maduro government in the past. Secretary of state Marco Rubio recently called Maduro a â horrible dictator â and repeatedly  championed US aid to Venezuela  while serving in the Senate. Last year,  Venezuela banned the social media platform X for 10 days  after Musk repeatedly attacked Maduro online. By the time the US funding contract terminations were announced, the mood this year at RightsCon was already tinged with anxiety and grief. Organizations impacted by the cuts rushed to attend hastily arranged closed-door meetings to swap information and strategize about how they would manage the fallout. Questions about how the human rights world should respond to the sudden and enormous funding gap also peppered many of the question-and-answer segments of speaker panels. One of the many recipients of the State Departmentâs DRL grants was Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, which supports journalists in places like Yemen and Libya, whose investigative work often puts them at risk of being harassed or killed. Rawan Damen, director of ARIJ, says the cuts represent about 20 percent of her organizationâs budget, or about half a million dollars. âWe don't want to lay off people. We have a small team of 30 people that we have groomed over 20 years,â Dawen says, adding that replacing their expertise would be costly and very difficult. Damen says that the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a congressionally funded nonprofit that disburses grants to a variety of smaller organizations that promote democracy efforts globally, was also a key funder for ARIJ. On February 25, NED  announced  it was âunable to access its congressionally appropriated fundsâ and therefore had to âto halt all partner support and furlough the majority of its staff.â In many cases, organizations like those represented at RightsCon work withâand employâmembers of particularly vulnerable populations, like religious minorities or members of the LGBTQ+ community. One nonprofit that spoke with WIRED said they prioritized hiring vulnerable workers, like Iranian asylum seekers, many of whom relied on employment with their organization to be able to remain safe in exile. US foreign aid, the vast majority of which flows through USAID, has been a  key target  of the Trump administration and DOGEâs stated efforts to shrink federal spending. (USAID represents less than 1 percent of the overall US federal budget and runs programs that  have been credited  with saving  millions of lives .) As Muskâs DOGE strike force has  gained access  to data systems at both USAID and the State Department, some nonprofit workers who spoke to WIRED said they feared that the cost-cutting group would be able to reviewâand shareâsensitive information they had provided to the US as a condition of receiving foreign aid funding. Organizations working in high-risk countries, particularly those that receive money from the State Department, are required to submit to background checks on their staff and contractors that are verified against US law enforcement databases. âOur details are there. You're talking about loads of names of people that work with us from loads of different regions,â says another nonprofit employee who focuses on human rights in Iran. âThat's actually been a really big concern for the whole community, because [Musk] has been posting stuff, and he doesn't care about the safety or security of our people.â The data security fears are not entirely unfounded:  DOGE reportedly shared classified information  on its website when it launched, and the US Central Intelligence Agency also recently sent an  unclassified email  with the names of some employees to the White House to comply with the Trump administrationâs orders to reduce the federal workforce. The US government, the nonprofit worker with projects in Asia said, has not been able to âassure us that the data is anyway segregated and not being viewed by parties from DOGE, and effectively, that could result in someone's information being shared online in a way that would put them at immediate risk of imprisonment and death.â The same worker says they worry that DOGE and the Trump administration are creating an environment that makes operating as a US federal grantee very risky. With the new rider, organizations are now vulnerable to lawsuits over suspected DEI practices that could bankrupt them. Such allegations might be especially difficult to disprove for organizations working with groups like women, religious minorities, or queer people. But itâs not just US-sponsored organizations that are concerned about the new environment in which they find themselves. Access Nowâs Al-Maskati says that entities based in the United States have also started to reach out for assistance, not necessarily for people they work with in other countries, but for their own staff at home, fearing that their workers will be harassed or targeted online. âBecause they do research about democracy,â he says.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-02-24 16:29:43",
    "body": "Dan Bongino has spent the last decade building a career in right-wing media based on his sycophantic support of  President Donald Trump  and his willingness to engage in endless conspiracy theories about everything from  Covid-19  and  the 2020 elections  to the FBI, which he has said should no longer exist in its current form. âThe FBI is no longer a law enforcement entity,â Bongino  wrote on X in 2023 . âIt is an oppo research firm for Democrats with an armed political enforcement branch.â He  also wrote  previously that he wants to âdisband the FBIâ and boosted conspiracy theories about its role in the Capitol insurrection. âI don't trust these people at all,â  Bongino wrote under a Facebook  video about the agency last year. On Sunday night, Trump announced on Truth Social that Bongino had been appointed as the agencyâs deputy director. Bongino, who previously served as a police officer in New York and as a Secret Service agent protecting former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, has no FBI experienceâa trait he shares with  Kash Patel, the QAnon-promoting Trump loyalist  who was last week confirmed as the new director of the FBI. The deputy director role, which oversees day-to-day operations of the bureau, has typically gone to an experienced FBI agent. In January, after he was nominated but before he was confirmed by the Senate, Patel met with two senior members of the FBI Agents Association, and, Patel âprivately agreedâ that âthe FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agentâas has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons.â This information was shared with the associationsâ members in a memo sent on Sunday evening, an hour before Trump announced Bonginoâs appointment, according to a copy of the newsletter reviewed by WIRED. âThere is a ton of concern that someone with no experience in the Bureau is appointed to, in the view of agents, a position that is even more important than the director,â one member of the association told WIRED. The person was granted anonymity over fears of recrimination from the new FBI leadership. Neither the FBI Agents Association nor a spokesperson for Patel immediately responded to a request for comment. Bongino is a Trump loyalist who has in the past referred to the president as âan apex predator.â A three-time failed congressional candidate, he has risen from the fringes of the online conspiracy community to become one of the most prominent voices in right-wing media, leveraging online platforms, as well as appearances on Fox News, to push wild conspiracy theories about the agency he will now help to oversee and about the government generally. (He has written a book called  Follow the Money: The Shocking Deep State Connections of the Anti-Trump Cabal .) A claimed proponent of free speech, Bongino is  prone to rants   and tirades  against anyone who criticizes him, and he  regularly blocks his critics  on social media. âDan Bongino is a Trump sycophant whose focus has been delegitimizing any and all legal steps taken against the president and his allies,â Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at media watchdog Media Matters who has tracked Bonginoâs career closely, tells WIRED. âBonginoâs appointment hammers home that Trump is building a federal law enforcement team that will carry out his desires to punish his political enemies: You donât select a bomb-throwing podcaster who has declared that âowning the libsâ is his sole focus in life to help run the FBI if youâre aiming for an impartial bureau.â Bongino served full-time in the NYPD from 1997 to 1999 before joining the Secret Service. He left in 2011 to pursue a political career, running for Senate as a Republican in Maryland in 2012. At the time, his opinion of his former employer was still very positive. âThe president was a wonderful guy,â Bongino said of Obama in 2011. âFrom what I saw he was a wonderful father and a wonderful man and he was very, very nice and very kind to me.â In a memoir published in 2013, Bongino added that Obama was âone of a group of men I would have gladly sacrificed my life for.â Around the same time, though, Bongino began to take his first steps on a path that would ultimately lead him to becoming one of the biggest podcasters in the US. In 2013 he appeared on Infowars, where he spoke to Alex Jones about the then recent shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. After Jones said itâs âso over-the-top how authoritarian the Democrats have becomeâ in response to school shootings, Bongino replied that Democrats arenât crisis managers but are instead âcrisis-leveraging [and] using a national emotional crisis to get you to believe things that simply arenât true.â A decade later Jones would be ordered by a court to liquidate his assets to pay the families of the victims of the shooting $1.5 billion. Bongino made multiple appearances on Jonesâ show in the run-up to his second failed congressional tilt in 2014, this time losing to incumbent Democratic representative John Delaney in Marylandâs 6th Congressional District. During one of his Infowars appearances, Bongino boosted the conspiracy theory that CIA agents were told to stand down during the terrorist attacks on the US Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya. Bongino began his own podcast,  The Dan Bongino Show , in 2015, and a year later made his third attempt at winning a seat in Congress, this time in Floridaâs 19th Congressional District. Just a week before the vote, Bongino was recorded having a full-on meltdown while speaking to a reporter from Politico, whom he called â a real disgusting piece of shit .â In 2018 Bongino was handed his own 30-minute show on the National Rifle Associationâs station, NRATV. Bongino used his show to continuously hammer the work being conducted by special counselâand former FBI directorâRobert Mueller, who was at the time investigating Trump and allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Bongino pushed the conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign was being spied on, a situation he dubbed âspygateâ and called âthe biggest scandal in American history.â During one show, discussing the pushback against the nomination of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Bongino said, âMy entire life right now is about owning the libs. Thatâs it. The libs â¦ have shown themselves through this Kavanaugh abomination of a process to be â¦ pure unadulterated evil.â His robust defense of Trump caught the attention of producers at Fox, who booked him hundreds of times during this period, and it appears to be at this point that Trump first took notice of Bongino. In June 2018, Trump quoted Bongino in two posts on Twitter after Bongino appeared on  Fox & Friends  slamming then CIA director John Brennan. Bongino connected with Trump, the Daily Beast reported in October 2018, writing that Trump spoke to his aides about âmalicious influences inside the FBI,â  citing Bongino as the source of his information . Bonginoâs NRATV show lasted less than a year, and in December 2018 when it was announced his show was ending,  Bongino reacted to critics  saying he had been fired and poking fun at his demise. A month later, Fox News signed Bongino as a contributor, despite the fact that he had been  reportedly barred from the set  of Shannon Breamâs show on the station for becoming âungluedâ during a recording. In 2021, Bongino became a Fox News host, with a Saturday night show called  Unfiltered , which he used to become one of the loudest voices pushing election-denial conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. He also used the platform to push  the great replacement conspiracy theory  and Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Bongino regularly railed against what he considered to be government overreach in relation to  mask and vaccine mandates . During the attack on the Capitol, Bongino was temporarily suspended from Twitter for posting a video originally shared by Trump, and in the days after the attack he  raged  about the decision to remove the messaging app Parler, in which he was an investor, from app stores. In 2022, YouTube finally took action against Bongino, who used to post his podcast on the platform, permanently banning him for spreading Covid-19 disinformation. However  Facebook continued to allow him  to use its platform, where he had built up a massive audience, to promote his conspiracy theories. Bongino left Fox News in 2023, but he has continued to grow his podcast on the alternative video streaming site Rumble, to which Vice President JD Vance has ties and in which he is an investor. While Bongino has not been as vocal a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory as his boss,  he has boosted QAnon figures  in the past, and his supporters on pro-Trump and conspiracy channels have been cheering his new role. These supporters claim that he and Patel will finally unmask the âdeep stateââa supposed group of government officials they believe have been waging a secret war on Trump. âTrump has brought together the dream team, the Avengers,â one prominent QAnon promoter wrote. âGet your popcorn ready.â Update 2/24/25 5:53pm ET: This story has been updated with additional information about the FBI Agents Association's view of the Bongino appointment.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-06 08:34:39",
    "body": "The United States Army is employing a prototype generative  artificial intelligence  tool to identify references to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) for removal from training materials in line with a recent executive order from President Donald Trump. Officials at the Armyâs Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)âthe major command responsible for training soldiers, developing leaders, and shaping the serviceâs guidelines, strategies, and conceptsâare currently using the AI tool, dubbed CamoGPT, to âreview policies, programs, publications, and initiatives for DEIA and report findings,â according to an internal memo reviewed by WIRED. The memo followed Trumpâs signing of a January 27  executive order  titled âRestoring Americaâs Fighting Force,â which directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to eliminate all Pentagon policies seen as promoting what that the commander in chief declared âun-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theoriesâ regarding race and gender, a  linguistic dragnet  that extends as far as  past social media posts  from official US military accounts. In an email to WIRED, TRADOC spokesman Army Major Chris Robinson confirmed the use of CamoGPT to review DEIA materials. TRADOC âwill fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the Executive Orders issued by the president. We ensure that these directives are carried out with the utmost professionalism, efficiency, and in alignment with national security objectives,â Robinson says. âSpecific details about internal policies and tactics cannot be discussed. However, the use of all tools in our portfolio, including CamoGPT, to increase productivity at all levels can and will be used.â Developed last summer to boost productivity and operational readiness across the US Army, CamoGPT currently has around 4,000 users who âinteractâ with it on a daily basis, Captain Aidan Doyle, a CamoGPT data engineer, tells WIRED. The tool is used for everything from developing comprehensive training program materials to producing multilingual translations, with TRADOC  providing  a âproof of concept and demonstrationâ at last Octoberâs annual Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC, according to Robinson. While Doyle declined to comment on the specifics on how TRADOC officials were likely using the CamoGPT to scan for DEIA-related policies, he described the process of searching through documents as relatively straightforward. âI would take all the documentation you want to examine, order it all in a collection on CamoGPT, and then ask questions about the documents,â he says. âThe way retrieval-augmented generation works is that the more specific your question is to the concepts inside the document, the more detailed information the model will provide back.â In practical terms, this means that TRADOC officials are likely inputting a large number of documents into CamoGPT and asking the LLM to scan for targeted keywords like âdignityâ or ârespectâ (which, yes, the Army is  currently using  to screen past digital content) to identify materials for subsequent alteration and bring them in line with Trumpâs executive order. By using CamoGPT, the work of eliminating DEIA-related content will likely result in a rapid change to the US Armyâs documentation. âWeâre competing with âcontrol+Fâ in Adobe Acrobat,â Doyle says. CamoGPT isnât the only AI chatbot in the Pentagonâs arsenal: The US Air Forceâs NIPRGPT has seen extensive use among airmen since its launch in June for âsummarization of documents, drafting of documents and coding assistance,â  according  to DefenseScoop. The AI-assisted assessment of US military training materials comes amid a government-wide effort to root out DEIA  initiated  the day Trump returned to the Oval Office in January to start his second term.  Detailed  in Trumpâs January 27 executive order, the Defense Departmentâs purge has taken the form of the closure of service-specific DEIA offices and program, a department-wide review of past DEI initiatives, and even the removal of historical content related to the famed all-Black Tuskegee Airmen from Air Force basic training materials, the latter of which was  swiftly reversed  amid public outcry. Originally inspired by the public release of OpenAIâs ChatGPT in November 2022, CamoGPT is a product of the Armyâs Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C), the organization formed in 2018 as part of Army Future Command to spearhead AI research and development efforts by âleveraging a soldier workforce to build experimental prototypes,â as Eric Schmitz, AI2Câs operations and intelligence portfolio lead, tells WIRED. âThe mission is to make AI accessible to the Army through experimentation, and we have an ethos and culture that is very much a start-up ethos.â Schmitz says. âWe are product-centric and believe AI is inherently software-driven: You can do all the research you like in academia, but if you don't have software to deliver it to somebody and find out if it's useful software, then youâll never know if your AI is useful in the real world.â In response to the arrival of ChatGPT, AI2C quickly spun up a CamoGPT prototype based on an open-source LLM in June 2024. The centerâs approach to CamoGPT is âmodel agnostic,â according to Schmitz: While the system currently relies on tech giant Metaâs open-source Llama 3.3 70B LLM, the underlying model is âexpendableâ should a better version hit the market. What really matters is building software that the average soldier will actually use in their day-to-day operations, an achievement that might influence its long-term adoption across the force. âWhen you talk about how the Army doesnât build software well, itâs because user adoption is not a priority, but itâs a massive priority to us,â Schmitz says. Whether CamoGPT proliferates more broadly across the Army remains to be seen, and Schmitz and Doyle emphasized that AI2Câs role is laser-focused on experimental prototyping rather than building products ready for immediate fielding. But with the entire federal government reorienting itself in the name of â efficiency ,â the success of CamoGPTâs application to Trumpâs DEIA overhaul may end up cementing its utility for military planners. âYou need to be ruthlessly critical of what you have built and what you plan to build and hyper focused on driving user adoption,â Schmitz says. âThe core question is, how do you build something thatâs so valuable that people say they can't live without it?â",

    "date": "2025-03-05 17:15:52",
    "body": "On Tuesday, the  General Services Administration  (GSA) published a list of more than 400 federal buildings and properties to be sold, including the FBI headquarters, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development , the Department of Justice, and other key federal  facilities . Hours later, 123 buildings, including high-profile sites like the J. Edgar Hoover Building and Veterans Administration buildings in Washington, DC, were removed from the list. By Wednesday, the entire list had disappeared from the GSA website. WIRED has created a map and a searchable table of the government properties that were for sale and briefly listed, which also includes corresponding political representatives for each location. WIRED cross-referenced two datasets to create the map: the list of ânon-coreâ properties originally publishedâand then removedâby the GSA, and the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties (IOLP). The GSA defines non-core properties as buildings and facilities that are ânot core to government operationsâ and in a press release about the list argued that sales would provide \"savings to the American taxpayer.\" The IOLP, a publicly accessible database, offers detailed information on GSA-owned and leased properties across the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. Among those originally denoted as for sale are historically significant properties like Chicagoâs Ludwig Mies van der Roheâ designed John C. Kluczynski Federal Building and the Custom House, an Art Deco building taking up a city block in Philadelphiaâs Old City. Less prominent but still notable buildings include the Martinsburg Computing Center in Kearneysville, West Virginia, which houses what the IRS describes as its âindividual and corporate tax administration master file data base,â and the  Central Heating Plant  in Washington, DC, which provides heated and chilled water to government buildings, museums, and national monuments. (The GSA has since claimed that not all buildings are for sale, but the agency has repeatedly changed its tune throughout different internal documents and communications to staffers.) The GSA, an independent government agency, manages government IT and a significant portion of the federal real estate portfolio. In recent weeks, the agency has been decimated by forced resignations and reductions in forces, including the elimination of 18F, a GSA unit focused on government efficiency. The GSAâs Public Buildings Service (PBS) is  reportedly  planning to cut 63 percent of its workforce, about 3,600 people in total. Elon Muskâs associates are staffed throughout the GSA, including Technology Transformation Services director Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer, and X staffer Nicole Hollander. A number of  young DOGE technologists  also have access to the agency. WIRED reported in February  that employees at the GSA were told to sell off more than 500 federal buildings, including properties that house government agencies and the offices of US senators. The list of these buildings divided the properties into âcoreâ and ânon-coreâ assets and designated the ânon-coreâ assets as to be sold. A note on the original list states that the agencyâs intention is eventually to reduce the âsize of the owned real estate footprint by 50 percent and the number of buildings by 70 percent. Reductions will be focused on the non-core general office space of the portfolio which can be replaced as needed in the private leased market. Moving forward, all non-core buildings will be disposed of and their tenants will be transitioned into leases.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at dmehro.89, leahfeiger.86, and timmarchman.01. The GSA has not said why it published and then subsequently removed the list. âSome have suggested [the list was taken down] due to the negative press,â says a source at GSA, who, along with others mentioned in this story, WIRED is granting anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press. âThere has been no national strategy on how GSA is supposed to engage customer agencies on their occupancy agreements in these buildings.â âOur portfolio [team] havenât heard anything from our national office on whatâs actually going on,â another source says. Other sources have described a small group at the GSA, walled off from other employees, making decisions in tandem with DOGE. âThe thing you need to realize is the administrator [of the GSA] and PBS commissioner are making these decisions in a vacuum,â says a source, referring to Michael Peters, the recently appointed PBS commissioner, and Stephen Ehikian, the acting GSA administrator. âThe regional staff, senior regional leadership, and most GSA national office staff donât get to talk to the administrator or PBS commissioner. They have a floor locked off at GSA headquarters with elevator access restricted. Theyâre in there with DOGE reps â¦ I know it sounds like a bad James Bond movie or Iâm making it up, but they literally have locked off a floor.â Peters and Ehikian did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The link to the list published to the GSA website has been replaced by a page that says âcoming soon.â âWe are identifying buildings and facilities that are not core to government operations, or non-core properties, for disposal,â the page states. âSelling ensures that taxpayer dollars are no longer spent on vacant or underutilized federal spaces. Disposing of these assets helps eliminate costly maintenance and allows us to reinvest in high-quality work environments that support agency missions.â In a Wednesday press statement, the GSA did not clarify why the list was deleted. âTo be clear, just because an asset is on the list doesnât mean itâs immediately for sale,â the statement reads. âHowever, we will consider compelling offers (in accordance with applicable laws and regulations) and do what's best for the needs of the federal government and taxpayer.â The agency added, âWe anticipate the list will be republished in the near future after we evaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.â The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, emailed employees about the list of buildings and noted that a number of its buildings were identified as ânon-coreâ assets. âCMS was not aware this was happening, and we didnât submit or approve any of our current office locations being on this list,â the email states. âWe are in active discussions with HHS to ensure we have the facilities we need to fully return to the office in-person and continue performing our critical mission.â Sources tell WIRED that the posting of the list yesterday has resulted in chaos at the GSA. âThereâs a reason we have processes, and they just donât follow them,â one source says. âAmateur hour,â says another source.

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-06 16:59:08",
    "body": "Former US congresswoman  Tulsi Gabbardâs ascendance to director of national intelligence last month signaled a major shift in views toward government surveillance at the highest rung of the US intelligence community. While backing down from some of her more extreme anti-surveillance views in the run-up to her confirmation, Gabbard nevertheless held fast to a few promises of reform that have been traditionally eschewed by federal law enforcement leaders. Now, some of the nationâs premier civil liberties organizations have begun lobbying Americaâs âtop spyâ to follow through on a pledge to bring about new levels of oversight and transparency to a key US surveillance program thatâs long been  plagued by reports of misuse . Led by the American Civil Liberties Union, at least 20 major privacy groups this week urged Gabbard to declassify information concerning Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)âthe nationâs cornerstone wiretap authority that, while aimed at collecting intelligence on foreigners overseas, is known to vacuum up large quantities of calls, texts, and emails belonging to Americans. In a letter first obtained by WIRED, the groups privately urged Gabbard this week to declassify information regarding the types of US businesses that  can now be secretly compelled to install wiretaps  on the US National Security Agencyâs (NSA) behalf. While itâs no secret that the government routinely compels phone and email service providers like AT&T and Google into conducting wiretaps, Congress passed a new provision last year  expanding  the range of businesses that can receive such orders. Legal experts had warned in advance that the provision was far too ambiguous and likely to vastly increase the number of Americans whose communications are wiretapped. But their warnings were not heeded. It is widely assumed that the classified purpose behind the expanded authority is allowing the government to obtain access to communications  in US data centers . Lawyers for the US Justice Department attempted to unilaterally expand the reach of the program in 2022, but its efforts were foiled by the secret surveillance court that oversees FISA. Only Congress has the power to expand FISA, the department was told. As its a matter of secret law, lawmakers were unable to specify much about the limits of the governmentâs access in the provision they ultimately passed. This inevitably led to the adoption of a vague new definition for what the government calls an âelectronic communications service providerâ (ECSP)âthe term for companies whose cooperation can be compelled under FISA. Privacy experts and industry leaders had likewise raised concerns about introducing ambiguity into a law that defines the scope of a powerful surveillance tool, warning the changes could expose a  near limitless range of new businesses  to secret government demands. As WIRED  reported last spring , opponents of the provision in Washington had cast the surveillance programâs new parameters as effectively âStasi-likeââa reference to the defunct East German secret police agency notorious for infiltrating industry and forcing private citizens to spy on one another. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a renowned privacy hawk who has served on the Senate intelligence committee since just after 9/11,  has referred  to the new provision as âone of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history.â Declassifying the new types of businesses that can actually be considered an ECSP is an essential step in bringing about clarity to an otherwise nebulous change in federal surveillance practices, according to the ACLU and the other organizations joined in its effort. âWithout such basic transparency, the law will likely continue to permit sweeping NSA surveillance on domestic soil that threatens the civil liberties of all Americans,â the groups wrote in their letter to Gabbard this week. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In addition to urging Gabbard to declassify details about the reach of the 702 program, the ACLU and others are currently pressing Gabbard to publish information to quantify just how many Americans have been âincidentallyâ wiretapped by their own government. Intelligence officials have long claimed that doing so would be âimpossible,â as any analysis of the wiretaps would involve the government accessing them unjustifiably, effectively violating those Americansâ rights. The privacy groups, however, point to research published in 2022 out of Princeton University, which details a methodology that could effectively solve that issue. âThe intelligence communityâs refusal to produce the requested estimate undermines trust and weakens the legitimacy of Section 702,â the groups say. Gabbard is  widely   reported  to have softened her stance against government spying while working to secure her new position as director of the nationâs intelligence apparatus. During the 116th Congress, for instance, Gabbard  introduced legislation  that sought to completely dismantle the Section 702 program, which is considered the âcrown jewelâ of US intelligence collection and crucial to keeping tabs on foreign threats abroad, including terrorist organizations and cybersecurity threatsâexhibiting a stance far more extreme than those traditionally held by lawmakers and civil society organizations whoâve long campaigned for surveillance reform. While begging off from this position in January, Gabbardâs newly espoused views have, in fact, brought her more closely in line with mainstream reformers. In response to questions from the US Senate ahead of her confirmation, for example, Gabbard backed the idea of requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain warrants before accessing the communications of Americans swept up by the 702 program. Slews of national security hawks from former House speaker Nancy Pelosi to former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Turner have long opposed this warrant requirement, as traditionally have all directors of the FBI. âThis warrant requirement strengthens the [intelligence community] by ensuring queries are targeted and justified,\" Gabbard wrote in response to Senate questions in late January. The Section 702 program was reauthorized last spring, but only for an additional two years. Early discussions about reauthorizing the program once more are expected to kick off again as early as this summer. Sean Vitka, executive director of Demand Progress, one of the organizations involved in the lobbying effort, notes that Gabbard has a long history of supporting civil liberties, and refers to her recent statements about secret surveillance programs âencouraging.â âCongress needs to know, and the public deserves to know, what Section 702 is being used for,â Vitka says, âand how many Americans are swept up in that surveillance.â âSection 702 has been repeatedly used to conduct warrantless surveillance on Americans, including journalists, activists, and even members of Congress,â adds Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel for the ACLU. âDeclassifying critical information, as well as providing long-overdue basic data about the number of US persons whose communications are collected under this surveillance are essential steps to increasing transparency as the next reauthorization debate approaches.â",

    "body": "Since  Elon Muskâs  so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  took over important government technology teams within the General Services Administration (GSA) and what was formally known as the  United States Digital Service  (USDS), around 200 technologists have either resigned or been fired, jeopardizing about a decadeâs worth of work dedicated to everything from public health to passport applications. The culling of  the GSAâs  18F division, in particular, a specialized digital services agency tasked with  improving user experience with government services  and helping agencies build and buy a variety of technologies, has crippled programs that silently but effectively prepared Americans for weather disasters or streamlined annoying errands, like renewing a passport or filing taxes. Over the weekend, around 90 technologists at 18F were  fired  via a surprise email that went out shortly before 1 am ET on Saturday. âItâs clear that whatâs been lost is much bigger than a handful of individual interrupted projects,â says one fired 18F worker, whom WIRED has granted anonymity, along with other sources mentioned in this story, to protect their privacy. âAn entire ecosystem of dedicated technologists optimizing for the public and supporting civil servants is being dismantled.â When the 18F team was disbanded, the group was in the middle of working on a number of projects for agencies across government, including the IRS, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. One of the most public-facing 18F-supported services is the IRSâs Direct File program, which allows taxpayers to file their taxes directly to the IRS for free. Direct File is a joint program with the IRS developed by 18F and USDS before the IRS team was able to take it over. This year, the service is available in 25 states. It will remain active, 18F employees tell WIRED, but the reduction in staff could make it harder to expand it to the remaining states. Within the State Departmentâs Bureau of Consular Affairs, 18F workers were in the middle of building a new system that would more efficiently process passport applications. Due to the firings, the bureau âis left with significantly reduced capacity and momentumâ dedicated to this work, sources from 18F tell WIRED. Before the firings, 18F was in the middle of revamping Weather.gov, the website for the National Weather Service, making it more user-friendly and stabilizing its public API, which outside applications use to provide weather information. As of this week, all development on the new site has stopped, employees tell WIRED, and its API improvement could slow dramatically. Weather has been a conservative point of interest for a while now:  Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundationâs presidential transition plan, proposes that an incoming Republican administration could commercialize weather forecasting, which has been the work of the National Weather Service for decades. Hundreds of workers for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  were also terminated last week âProject 2025 did call for the privatization of some functions of the NOAA. â18F was the peopleâs tech shop,â one fired 18F worker tells WIRED. âThereâs a giant hole left by the closure of 18F. Requests from across the country for help far outpaced 18Fâs capacity before the closure.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Like 18F, the  United States Digital Service , which the Trump administration rebranded into DOGE, has seen waves of firings and resignations. On February 14, around 50 USDS staffers were terminated, primarily affecting project managers and designers. Last week, another 21 resigned,  writing in an open letter  obtained by WIRED that DOGEâs âscorched earth approach is driving away the people who actually have the skills to fix the governmentâs problems.â Itir Cole, a USDS project lead with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), resigned from her position last week after a majority of her team was fired and locked out of their computers before they could pass along their responsibilities. âTheyâre destructive and toxic. I didnât want to be associated with it or have entanglements because of a deferred resignation,â Cole says of DOGE. âThe job changed. I didnât sign up to work for Elon. I signed up to work for the American people. And when that changed I decided to leave.â For more than a year, Cole helped manage the development of the CDCâs Disease Surveillance system, which aided in the tracking and prevention of dangerous pathogens and illnesses like Anthrax and Zika across the country. âIt puts vulnerable populations into even more vulnerable situations,â says Cole. âThe program is probably going to die. There aren't enough people to work on it. I know folks who are left over at the CDC are working very hard to find alternative plans.â Inside GSAâs Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which formerly housed 18F, the recent firings have spooked the remaining technologists. Some employees, sources tell WIRED, have been reassigned to more public-facing projects like Login.gov, where Americans sign in to access benefits like VA services, Social Security, and Cloud.gov, which offers cloud hosting services to other agencies. âThe big change in how people are thinking about things is, why did they interview everyone about their skills and shit if they are just lopping off entire appendages of TTS?â one current TTS worker says. In early February, young DOGE engineers, like Edward âBig Ballsâ Coristine,  met with TTS workers , demanding information on their work and sometimes asking to review code. In a Thursday town hall meeting, Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now at the helm of TTS, announced that the workforce reductions at the agency werenât over. Shedd, says one TTS employee, âsat there four inches from the screen reading the entire time from his prewritten script and looked/sounded like a hostage recording a proof-of-life video.â Over the next few weeks, Shedd said, GSAâs tech arm would shrink by 50 percent. Any projects not required by law would be shut down, and the agency would prioritize more public-facing services like Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and FedRAMP, which promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across government. The DOGE executive order has authorized the group to operate only through the beginning of July, so itâs unclear what will then happen to these projects and teams.",

    "body": "Mass layoffs and weak leadership are taking a severe toll on  the US governmentâs cyber defense agency , undermining its ability to protect America from foreign adversaries bent on crippling infrastructure and ransomware gangs that are bleeding small businesses dry. Inside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, vital support staff are gone, international partnerships have been strained, and workers are afraid to discuss  threats to democracy  that theyâre now prohibited from countering. Employees are even more overworked than usual, and new assignments from the administration are interfering with important tasks. Meanwhile, CISAâs temporary leader is doing everything she can to appease President Donald Trump, infuriating employees who say sheâs out of touch and refusing to protect them. âYou've got a lot of people who â¦ are looking over their shoulder as opposed to looking at the enemy right now,â says one CISA employee. As the Trump administrationâs war on the federal bureaucracy throws key agencies into chaos, CISAâs turmoil could have underappreciated consequences for national security and economic prospects. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has steadily built a reputation as a nonpartisan source of funding, guidance, and even direct defensive support for cities, businesses, and nonprofits reeling from cyberattacks. That mission is now under threat, according to interviews with seven CISA employees and another person familiar with the matter, all of whom requested anonymity to avoid reprisals. âOur enemies are not slowing their continuous assaults on our systems,â says Suzanne Spaulding, who led CISAâs predecessor during the Obama administration. âWe need all hands on deck and focused, not traumatized and distracted.â Talent Exodus CISAâs mission has grown significantly since its creation in 2018. Established mainly to defend government networks, the agency increasingly embraced new roles supporting private companies and state governments, advocating for secure software, and cooperating with foreign partners. This helped CISA raise its profile and gain credibility. But now, following several rounds of layoffs and new restrictions from the Trump administration, the agency is struggling to sustain its momentum. The extent of the cuts at CISA is still unclearâemployees are only learning about the loss of colleagues through word of mouthâbut multiple employees estimate that, between the layoffs and the Office of Personnel Managementâs deferred-resignation program, CISA has lost between 300 and 400 staffersâroughly 10 percent of  its 3,200-person workforce . Many of those people were hired through DHSâs Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS), a program designed to recruit experts by competing with private-sector salaries. As a result, they were classified as probationary employees for three years, making them vulnerable to layoffs. These layoffs at CISA also hit longtime government workers who had become probationary by transferring into CTMS roles. Key employees who have left include  Kelly Shaw ,  who oversaw  one of CISAâs marquee programs,  a voluntary threat-detection service  for critical infrastructure operators;  David Carroll , who led the Mission Engineering Division, the agencyâs technological backbone; and Carrollâs technical director,  Duncan McCaskill . âWe've had a very large brain drain,â an employee says. The departures have strained a workforce that was already stretched thin. âWe were running into [a] critical skills shortage previously,â says a second employee. âMost people are and have been doing the work of two or more full-time [staffers].â The CISA team that helps critical infrastructure operators respond to hacks has been understaffed for years. The agency added support positions for that team after  a Government Accountability Office audit , but âmost of those people got terminated,â a third employee says. CISAâs flagship programs have been mostly unscathed so far. That includes the  threat-hunting branch , which analyzes threats, searches government networks for intruders, and responds to breaches. But some of the laid-off staffers provided crucial âbackendâ support for threat hunters and other analysts. âThere's enhancements that could be made to the tools that they're using,â the first employee says. But with fewer people developing those improvements, âwe're going to start having antiquated systems.â In a statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin says CISA remains âcommitted to the safety and security of the nationâs critical infrastructureâ and touted âthe critical skills that CISA experts bring to the fight every day.â National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt says the reporting in this story is ânonsense,â adding that âthere have been no widespread layoffs at CISA and its mission remains fully intact.â âWe continue to strengthen cybersecurity partnerships, advance AI and open-source security, and protect election integrity,â Hewitt says. âUnder President Trumpâs leadership, our administration will make significant strides in enhancing national cybersecurity.â Partnership Problems CISAâs external partnershipsâthe cornerstone of its effort to understand and counter evolving threatsâhave been especially hard-hit. International travel has been frozen, two employees say, with tripsâand even online communications with foreign partnersârequiring high-level approvals. That has hampered CISAâs collaboration with other cyber agencies, including those of âFive Eyesâ allies Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, staffers say. CISA employees canât even communicate with people at other federal agencies the way they used to. Previously routine conversations between CISA staffers and high-level officials elsewhere now need special permissions, slowing down important work. âI canât reach out to a CISO about an emergency situation without approval,â a fourth employee says. Meanwhile, companies have expressed fears about sharing information with CISA and even using the agencyâs free attack-monitoring services due to DOGEâs  ransacking of agency computers , according to two employees. âThere is advanced concern about all of our services that collect sensitive data,â the third employee says. âPartners [are] asking questions about what DOGE can get access to and expressing concern that their sensitive information is in their hands.â âThe wrecking of preestablished relationships will be something that will have long-lasting effects,â the fourth employee says. CISAâs  Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative , a high-profile hub of government-industry cooperation, is also struggling. The JCDC currently works with more than 300 private companies to exchange threat information, draft defensive playbooks, discuss geopolitical challenges, and publish advisories. The unit wants to add hundreds more partners, but it has âhad difficulty scaling this,â the first employee says, and recent layoffs have only made things worse. Contractors might be able to help, but the JCDCâs âvendor support contracts run out in less than a year,â the employee says, and as processes across the government have been frozen or paused in recent weeks, CISA doesnât know if it can pursue  new agreements . The JCDC doesn't have enough federal workers to pick up the slack, the fourth CISA employee says. With fewer staffers to manage its relationships, the JCDC confronts a perilous question: How should it focus its resources without jeopardizing important visibility into the threat landscape? Emphasizing ties with major companies might be more economical, but that would risk overlooking mid-sized firms whose technology is  quietly essential  to vital US industries. âCISA continuously evaluates how it works with partners,â McLaughlin says, âand has taken decisive action to maximize impact while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and aligning with Administration priorities and our authorities.â Gutting Security Advocacy Other parts of CISAâs mission have also begun to atrophy. During the Biden administration,  CISA vowed  to help the tech industry understand and mitigate the risks of open-source software, which is often poorly maintained and  has repeatedly   been exploited  by hackers. But since Trump took office, CISA has lost the three technical luminaries who oversaw that work:  Jack Cable ,  Aeva Black , and  Tim Pepper . Open-source security remains a major challenge, but CISAâs efforts to address that challenge are now rudderless. The new administration has also frozen  CISAâs work on artificial intelligence . The agency had been researching ways to use AI for vulnerability detection and networking monitoring, as well as partnering with the private sector to study AI risks. âAbout 50 percent of [CISAâs] AI expert headcount has been let go,â says a person familiar with the matter, which is âseverely limitingâ CISAâs ability to help the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute test AI models before deployment. The administration also pushed out CISAâs chief AI officer,  Lisa Einstein , and closed down her office, the person familiar with the matter says. Einsteinâs team oversaw CISAâs use of AI and worked with private companies and foreign governments on AI security. A large team of DHS and CISA AI staffers was set to accompany Vice President JD Vance to Paris in February for an AI summit, but those experts âwere all pulled backâ from attending, according to a person familiar with the matter. âNefariousâ Retribution CISA staffers are still reeling from the agencyâs  suspension of its election security program  and the layoffs of most people who worked on that mission. The election security initiative, through which CISA provided free services and guidance to state and local officials and worked with tech companies to track online misinformation, became a target of  right-wing conspiracy theories  in 2020, which  marked it for death  after Trumpâs return to the White House. The programâon hold pending CISAâs review of a recently completed internal assessmentâwas a tiny part of CISAâs budget and operations, but the campaign against it has alarmed agency employees. âThis is definitely in the freak-out zone,â says the first employee, who adds that CISA staffers across the political spectrum support the agencyâs efforts to track online misinformation campaigns. âAll of us recognize that this is a common deception tactic of the enemy.â The election security purge rippled across the agency, because some of the laid-off staffers had moved from elections to other assignments or were simultaneously working on both missions.  Geoff Hale , who led the elections team between 2018 and 2024, was serving as the chief of partnerships at the JCDC when he was placed on administrative leave, setting off a scramble to replace him. The removal of Hale and his colleagues âwas the start to a decline in moraleâ at CISA, according to the second employee. Now, staffers are afraid to discuss certain topics in public forums: âNo one's going to talk about election security right now,â the first employee says. âThe fact that thereâs retribution from the president â¦ is kind of frightening,â this employee adds. âA very nefarious place to be.â Abandoned and Demoralized The layoffs, operational changes, and other disruptions at CISA have severely depleted morale and undermined the agencyâs effectiveness. âEven simple tasks feel hard to accomplish because you don't know if your teammates won't be here tomorrow,â says the fourth employee. The biggest source of stress and frustration is acting CISA director Bridget Bean, a  former Trump appointee  who, employees say, appears eager to please the president even if it means not defending her agency. Bean âjust takes whatever comes down and implements [it] without thought of how it will affect [CISAâs] mission,â the fifth employee says. Employees describe her as a poor leader and ineffective communicator who has zealously enacted Trumpâs agenda. In town-hall meetings with employees, Bean has  said CISA must carefully review its its authorities  and urged staffers to  âassume noble intentâ  when dealing with Trump officials. While discussing Elon Muskâs mass-buyout program,  she allegedly said , âI like to say âFork in the Roadâ because it's kind of fun,.â according to the fourth employee. She was so eager to comply with Muskâs âWhat did you do last week?â email that she  instructed staffers to respond  to it before DHS had finalized its department-wide approach. DHS later told staff not to respond, and Bean  had to walk back  her directive. âBean feels like she's against the workforce just to please the current administration,â the second employee says. The fourth employee describes her as ânot authentic, tone-deaf, spineless, [and] devoid of leadership.â McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, says CISA âis not interested in ad hominem attacks against its leadership,â which she says âhas doubled down on openness and transparency with the workforce.â The return-to-office mandate has also caused problems. With all employees on-site, there isnât enough room in CISAâs offices for the contractors who support the agencyâs staff. That has made it âvery difficultâ to collaborate on projects and hold technical discussions, according to the first employee. âThere wasnât much thought about [RTOâs] impact to operations,â says the fourth employee. According to a fifth employee, âexecuting some of our sensitive operations is now harder.â (âCISA has worked tirelessly to make the return to office as smooth as possible from space to technology,â McLaughlin says.) Employees are dealing with other stressors, too. They have no idea whoâs reading their Musk-mandated performance reports, how theyâre being evaluated, or whether AI is analyzing them for future layoffs. And thereâs a lot of new paperwork. âThe amount of extra shit we have to do to comply with the âefficiency measuresâ â¦ [takes] a lot of time away from doing our job,â says the fifth employee. Bracing for More When Trump  signed the bill  creating CISA in November 2018, he said the agencyâs workforce would be âon the front lines of our cyber defenseâ and âmake us, I think, much more effective.â Six and a half years later, many CISA employees see Trump as the biggest thing holding them back. âThis administration has declared psychological warfare on this workforce,â the fourth employee says. With CISA drawing up  plans for even larger cuts , staffers know the chaos is far from over. âA lot of people are scared,â says the first employee. âWeâre waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.â Entire wings of CISAâlike National Risk Management Center and the Stakeholder Engagement Divisionâcould be on the chopping block. Even in offices that survive, some of the governmentâs most talented cyber expertsâpeople who chose public service over huge sums of money and craved the lifestyle of CISAâs now-eliminated remote-work environmentâare starting to see their employment calculus differently. Some of them will likely leave for stabler jobs, further jeopardizing CISAâs mission. âWhat is the organization going to be capable of doing in the future?â the first employee asks. If Trumpâs confrontational foreign-policy strategy escalates tensions with Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea, itâs likely those nations could step up their use of cyberattacks to exact revenge. In that environment, warns Nitin Natarajan, CISAâs deputy director during the Biden administration, weakening the agency could prove very dangerous. âCuts to CISAâs cyber mission,â Natarajan says, âwill only negatively impact our ability to not only protect federal government networks, but those around the nation that Americans depend on every day.â",

    "body": "As President  Donald Trump  has been trying to keep House Republicans in line over a continuing resolution to keep the government open through the fall,  Elon Musk  has expressed a desire for a  government  shutdown, four sources familiar with his position tell WIRED. Sources also tell WIRED that Musk has wanted a government shutdownâan aim that runs contrary to the White Houseâs stated desire to avoid oneâin part because it would potentially make it easier to  eliminate the jobs  of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, essentially achieving a permanent shutdown. The sources, whom WIRED has granted anonymity, specifically asked to be described generically because information about Muskâs support for a shutdown is closely held. âA shutdown has been his preference,â says one Republican familiar with the situation, referring to Musk. âI think heâs boxed in there by the president. I think it would be really hard for him to get around that.â A second Republican who had heard about Muskâs desire for a government shutdown tells WIRED that the billionaireâs goal is for the continuing resolutionâa spending bill to temporarily fund the governmentâto tank, if only to achieve a brief government shutdown. âYou know none of this is about saving money, right?â says a third Republican familiar with the behind-the-scenes push from Musk. âItâs all about destroying a liberal power base.â Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The possible shutdown looms as Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  has slashed its way through the government, eliminating the positions of an estimated  tens of thousands of workers . If a government shutdown occurs, many federal agencies and programs would be essentially put on ice. Agencies like the FBI and others with law enforcement and security functions would largely continue to operate as normalâalbeit with some government workers not being paid until after the end of the shutdownâand critical functions like the issuance of Social Security checks would not be directly affected. Every department has a  shutdown plan , though, and most would be impacted. Ahead of a shutdown, federal employees are effectively classified into essential or nonessential work, with nonessential employees furloughed and not allowed to work until the shutdown ends. According to federal agency contingency plans  compiled  by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service in 2023, when a federal shutdown was narrowly averted, the pool of workers who would be subject to being furloughed then numbered about 850,000, with about 410,000 of those being outside the Department of Defense. Federal personnel costs, including military spending, amount to about $340 billion annually, so even laying off all of the third or so of federal workers considered nonessential could possibly save about $110 billion a yearâa fraction of the $1 trillion in annual federal spending Musk has claimed he wants to eliminate. Musk has spoken about removing so-called nonessential workersâmany of whom perform critical tasks like inspecting food, processing applications for benefits programs, and collecting weather dataâbefore. âIf the job is not essential, or they are not doing it well, they obviously shouldnât be on the public payroll,â  Musk told reporters  in late February, according to The New Yorker. Got a Tip? Do you know anything about the possible government shutdown or Elon Musk's work with DOGE? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, Leak2Lahut.26, and Vittoria89.82. According to  The Hill , Senate Democratsâeight of whose votes would be needed to ultimately pass the continuing resolutionâare concerned that a government shutdown could impact federal workers on furlough. Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, said that he is concerned about Musk and the timing of the shutdown. âMaybe they decide that entire government agencies donât need to exist anymore,â Kelly said on Monday. Democrats, save for a couple of  potential yes votes  from House members in districts Trump carried heavily, have been in a bind over supporting a bill that would keep the government open without addressing Muskâs work with DOGE. âIt is not something we could ever support,â House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York  said of the continuing resolution  on Monday, noting âDemocrats will not be complicit.â Many federal employees are also worried that a temporary shutdown could lead to permanent cuts. âThere are concerns anyone deemed nonessential will be DOGEâd,â a State Department employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, tells WIRED. The length of a possible government shutdown could also impact the dynamics, says Nick Bednar, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. A 30-day shutdown is a method of temporarily removing federal employees, he says. Many agencies have already been required to submit reduction in force (RIF) plans by March 13, but a shutdown plan is likely to be even more austere, allowing for only employees deemed essential to keep working. Guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) says that essential workers are those whose roles involve the âsafety of human life or the protection of property or the performance of certain other types of âexcepted work activities.ââ Bednar says that under OPM guidance, there are different ways in which agencies can reduce their manpower: an emergency furlough like a shutdown, a planned long-term furlough lasting more than 30 days, and layoffs. Both planned long-term furloughs and layoffs trigger RIF procedures. OPM guidance suggests that RIF procedures would not apply to an emergency one that crosses the 30-day threshold. How an agency decides who to furlough during an extended shutdown is still up for debate, says Bednar. In the event of an emergency furlough, Bednar says, \"The agency must apply the furlough uniformly and consistently.\" Even though the agency is not required to follow the RIF procedures in the event of an emergency furlough, an independent civil service oversight board considers those rules when determining whether the agency has adopted a furlough fairly. Bednar says, \"We are in uncharted territory. There is not a lot of case law discussing how agencies should apply emergency furloughs.â In a  February 11 executive order , the White House ordered agency heads to develop a plan for âlarge-scale reductions in forceâ that would prioritize âall components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.â The order provided a carve-out for âfunctions related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.â âA shutdown is aligned with the goals of DOGE,â says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. âIn the president's executive order, he told DOGE to focus on nonessential employees, which is to say employees who are designated as nonessential during government shutdowns.â Only one partial government shutdown, in the winter of 2018â19, has lasted more than 30 days. A report from the  Congressional Budget Office later estimated  that the 35-day shutdown âdelayed $18 billion in federal spending and suspended some federal services, thus lowering the projected level of real GDP in the first quarter of 2019 by $8 billion.â But for the most part, if a possible shutdown does last longer than 30 days, the US could enter into unknown territory. âOne difficulty in assessing what will happen is that there have only been 10 shutdowns that have resulted in furloughs in US history,â Bednar says. âMost of the case law we have on this issue comes from the 2013 shutdown, which was less than 30 days.â During the 2013 government shutdown, employees who tried to challenge their agenciesâ furloughs and sued for  back pay almost universally lost their cases . Bednar says, however, that if the Trump administration tries to use a government shutdown as an excuse to permanently eliminate jobs, employees might be able to appeal the decision. âI suspect the greatest impact of a long-term shutdown is that it will encourage federal employees to leave public service sooner rather than later,â says Bednar. âEven though federal law permits back pay, federal employees still need to pay for rent, groceries, and other essentials. The Trump administration could use an extended furlough to squeeze employees from their positions.â The White House believes that the lone holdout on the bill to avoid a shutdown will be Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who has firmly stated that he will not support the continuing resolution. Trump railed against Massie in a late-night post on Monday on Truth Social while trying to simultaneously praise the House Freedom Caucusâof which Massie is a memberâfor holding the line. âThank you to the House Freedom Caucus for just delivering a big blow to the Radical Left Democrats and their desire to raise Taxes and SHUT OUR COUNTRY DOWN! They hate America and all it stands for,â Trump wrote, before calling for a primary challenge to Massie, who has  prevailed over similar calls  in the past. Later in the post, Trump wrote âDO I HAVE ANY TAKERS??? Anyway, thank you again to the House Freedom Caucus for your very important vote. We need to buy some time in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. Unite and Win!!!â If the continuing resolution passes, that would not take the issue off the table entirely, as it would only fund the government through September.

    "body": "The  Office of Personnel Managementâs  acting inspector general has confirmed that the independent office is investigating whether any âemerging threatsâ to sensitive information have arisen as a result of  Elon Muskâs   DOGE  operatives introducing rapid changes to protected government networks. âThe OPM OIG [office of the inspector general] is committed to providing independent and objective oversight of OPMâs programs and operations,â writes the acting inspector general, Norbert Vint,  in a letter  dated March 7 to Democratic lawmakers, adding that his office is not only legally required to scrutinize OPMâs security protocols, but routinely does so based on âdeveloping risks.â The letter stated that the office would fold specific requests issued by Democratic lawmakers last month into its âexisting work,â while also initiating a ânew engagementâ over potential risks at the agency associated with computer systems that have been accessed or modified by the United States DOGE Service. Vint, whose predecessor was fired by Trump in January, is one of a half dozen deputy inspectors general  urged by Democrats  on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month to investigate  reports from WIRED  and  other outlets  about DOGEâs efforts to gain access to a wide range of record systems that host some of the governmentâs most sensitive data, including personnel files on millions of government employees and their families. âWe are deeply concerned that unauthorized system access could be occurring across the federal government and could pose a major threat to the personal privacy of all Americans and to the national security of our nation,â Gerald Connolly, the oversight committeeâs ranking Democrat, wrote in a letter on February 6. In addition to OPM, Democrats have pressed for similar security assessments at five other agencies, including at the Treasury Department, the General Services Administration, the Small Business Administration, the US Agency for International Development, and the Department of Education. However, Vint is the only watchdog at any of the named agencies to have responded so far, a committee spokesperson tells WIRED. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030. While in the minority in the House and Senate, Democrats have little power to conduct effective oversight outside of formal hearings, which must be convened by Republicans. During his first term, Trumpâs Justice Department issued guidance notifying executive agencies that they had zero obligation to respond to questions from Democrats. Congressional Republicans have committed to little, if any, formal oversight of DOGEâs work, opting instead to  back-channel  with the billionaire over the impacts of his anti-personnel crusade. The executive order establishing DOGE, signed by the president on his first day in office, instructed federal agencies to provide Muskâs operatives with âfull and prompt accessâ to all unclassified records systems in order to effectuate a government-wide purge of âfraud, waste, and abuse.â It quickly became clear, however, that DOGEâs staff, many of them  young engineers  with direct ties to Muskâs own businesses, were paying little attention to key privacy safeguards; eschewing, for instance,  mandatory assessments  of new technologies installed on protected government networks. âSeveral of the concerns you expressed in your letter touch on issues that the OPM OIG evaluates as part of our annual reviews of OPMâs IT and financial systems, and we plan to incorporate those concerns into these existing projects,â writes Vint in the March 7 letter. âWe have also just begun an engagement to assess risks associated with new and modified information systems at OPM. We believe that, ultimately, our new engagement will broadly address many of your questions related to the integrity of OPM systems.â",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-26 16:44:21",
    "body": "A Venmo account under the name âMichael Waltz,â carrying a profile photo of the  national security adviser  and connected to accounts bearing the names of people closely associated with him, was  left open to the public  until Wednesday afternoon. A WIRED analysis shows that the account revealed the names of hundreds of Waltzâs personal and professional associates, including journalists, military officers, lobbyists, and othersâinformation a foreign intelligence service or other actors could exploit for any number of ends, experts say. Among the accounts linked to âMichael Waltzâ are ones that appear to belong to Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Walker Barrett, a  staffer  on the United States National Security Council. Both were fellow participants in a  now-infamous Signal group chat  called âHouthi PC small group.â The White House declined to comment after being presented with WIREDâs findings, but the accounts appearing to belong to Waltz and Wiles went fully private following WIREDâs inquiry. Earlier this week, The Atlantic  reported  that an account with the name âMichael Waltzâ accidentally invited the publicationâs editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat, in which senior administration officials discussed plans for a strike on Yemen. (Waltz  told  Fox Newsâ Laura Ingraham he takes âfull responsibilityâ for inviting Goldberg, adding, âWe have some of the best technology minds looking at how this happened.â) Over the encrypted messaging app, which Department of Defense guidelines  bar  from being used for the discussion of any nonpublic defense information, the group debated whether a strike should be carried out at all. Hours after an account with the name of defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared missile targets, strike timing, and other highly sensitive operational details of a coming strike, US forces bombed Houthi targets in Yemen, reportedly killing at least 53 people. A WIRED review of public data exposed on Venmo accounts associated with senior administration officials suggests that the Signal group chat was not an isolated mistake, but part of a broader pattern of what national security experts describe as reckless behavior by some of the most powerful people in the US government. The Venmo account under Waltzâs name includes a 328-person friend list. Among them are accounts sharing the names of people closely associated with Waltz, such as Barrett, formerly Waltzâs deputy chief of staff when Waltz was a member of the House of Representatives, and Micah Thomas Ketchel, former chief of staff to Waltz and currently a senior adviser to Waltz and President Donald Trump. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at  dmehro.89 or timmarchman.01. Other accounts carry the names of a wide range of media figures, from on-air personalities like Bret Baier and Brian Kilmeade of Fox News and Brianna Keilar and Kristen Holmes of CNN to a cable news producer, a prominent national security reporter, local news anchors, documentarians, and noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself the âthe secretary of retributionâ and once created a  deep state  target list. (Fox News declined to comment; CNN did not respond to a request for comment.) Many of the accounts appear to belong to local and national politicians and political operatives ranging from US representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas to a former mayor of Deltona, Florida, as well as venture capitalists, defense industry entrepreneurs, and executives like Christian Brose, the president of defense tech giant Anduril. (Crenshawâs office and Anduril did not respond to requests for comment.) One of the most notable appears to belong to Wiles, one of Trumpâs most trusted political advisers. That accountâs 182-person friend list includes accounts sharing the names of influential figures like Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Hope Hicks, Trumpâs former White House communications director. While none of the Venmo transactions for the account listed for Waltz, Wiles, or Barrett were publicly visible, it appears that none of them had opted out of sharing their contact list, allowing their friend lists to remain visible to the public. After WIRED reached out to the White House for comment, both Waltz and Wiles appeared to change their Venmo privacy settings to hide their friend lists. Venmo spokesperson Erin Mackey said in a statement, âWe take our customersâ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends listsâand we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.â The comment is nearly identical to the one Venmo provided to WIRED in response to a  2024 story about now-vice president JD Vanceâs Venmo . Last July, WIRED reported that Vance had left his Venmo account public, exposing a network of connections to Project 2025 architects, DOJ officials, Yale Law classmates, and far-right media figures. (While it was not reported at the time, WIREDâs analysis of that public Venmo accountâand the networks of his listed friendsâfound that the Michael Waltz Venmo account appeared in Vanceâs extended network, comprising friends and friends of friends.) According to The Atlantic, Vance was also an active participant in the Signal chat alongside Waltz, where he questioned whether the planned military operation in Yemen aligned with President Trumpâs broader message on Europe. When the Michael Waltz account was set up in 2017, the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,  criticized  this design, arguing that it exposes users to unnecessary risks by making social connections public by default. It wasnât until BuzzFeed News revealed in 2021 that then-president Joe Biden was easily found on the app that Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, added the option to hide friend lists. But that setting remains opt-in.  According to its privacy policy , unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. Mixed in with the high-profile names connected to the apparent Waltz Venmo account are a number of accounts appearing to belong to ordinary people, such as several doctors, real estate agents, and a tailor. These are the kinds of low-level connections that, experts say, spies look at for basic informationâa relationship with a medical specialist could expose that a person is being treated for an illness that hasnât been made publicâas well as patterns, pressure points, or a way in. Experts call them âsoft targetsâ: people who have access but arenât protected. For instance, when the US and Israel reportedly sabotaged Iranâs nuclear program with the  Stuxnet virus,  they used a control engineerâs USB stick, not one belonging to a senior official. Chinese intelligence has used similar tactics, contacting thousands of foreign citizens  using LinkedIn  or  going after university  students to get closer to US researchers and companies. While WIRED has found no evidence that foreign adversaries have used Venmo to target a US politicianâs network, the platform makes these relationships visibleâpotentially giving adversaries a searchable map of the people around power. âThe first thing you think of is the counterintelligence issue, right? And the security vulnerabilities. It kind of boggles the mind, in a way,â says Michael Ard, a former intelligence analyst who now runs the masters program in intelligence analysis at Johns Hopkins. âIt would be really easy for somebody to spoof a contact, and that is something the security industry has already been issuing notices on.â Waltz has spent years inside the Republican national security establishment. A former Green Beretâsomething reflected in the number of apparent veteran Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and other special operators to whom the Venmo account bearing his name is connectedâhe served as a defense adviser at the Pentagon under former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, and later counseled US vice president Dick Cheney on counterterrorism. In 2020, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Waltz says he was part of a small group of lawmakers privately briefed at the White House. Another participant in that thread was Hegseth. A public Venmo account under his name,  identified by The American Prospect  in February, revealed a similarly elite networkâincluding names matching executives at defense firms like Palantir and Anduril as well as lobbyists and President George W. Bushâera officials. In the Signal chat, the defense secretary directly responded to Vanceâs concerns: âVP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. Itâs PATHETIC.â Both Vanceâs and Hegsethâs Venmo accounts have since been deleted. Jake Lahut contributed reporting.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-27 10:10:45",
    "body": "In January, with a  nationwide ban  on TikTok looming, hundreds of thousands of people in the US  began flocking  to another Chinese social media app called RedNoteâonly to find that Maye Musk, Elon Muskâs mother, had already established a relatively large audience on the platform. Maye, who has become a celebrity in her own right in China over the past few years, had over 600,000 followers on RedNote when the flood of Americans arrived. âI need to find the block button,â one American user commented under Mayeâs  latest video at the time , which has received over 10,000 likes. âI canât believe Iâm witnessing American people confronting Muskâs mom to her face,â another comment in Chinese reads. Shortly afterward, Mayeâs comment section on RedNote was closed for several weeks. New comments didnât start showing up again until early February. The incident represented a rare moment when the parallel public images Maye Musk has created for herself collided. In China, the 76 year-old has built a largely apolitical reputation as a â silver influencer ,â fashion model for local brands, and book author who regularly garners  positive coverage  in Chinese state media, The New York Times previously reported. Last week, she made another trip to China,  this time  to the city of Wuxi, where she was invited to watch a drone show, promoted traditional crafts, and posed with a special Tesla model that comes in  different colorways  sold only in Asia. But in the US, Mayeâs career has increasingly converged with Elonâs as her son gained  unprecedented power  and influence over the US federal government. Since President Trump won reelection, Maye has traveled on Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-a-Lago dinner party, and attended a luncheon with Ivanka Trump, while also regularly firing off posts on X about US politics, according to a WIRED review of her social media presence. In many ways, Maye appears to be trying to straddle the fine line between her political engagement in the US and her business dealings in China and other foreign countries. That endeavor has become more fraught over the past two months as Trump began radically reshaping US foreign policy, including imposing new tariffs on China. âThereâs a heightened risk now for American business people traveling to China and that continues to increase, especially as tensions in the trade war will increase,â says Holden Triplett, cofounder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former senior FBI official posted in Beijing. Maye Muskâs business manager and Creative Artists Agency, her talent-representative agency in China, did not reply to requests for comment from WIRED. Even before she began traveling regularly to China, Maye publicly supported Elonâs and Teslaâs business endeavors in the country. In 2015, she retweeted a post by Elon in which he mentioned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. âGreat trip to China seeing President Xi ... Pic w China team in state garden,â the tweet reads, which was later deleted from Elonâs profile. Mayeâs retweet, however, was still accessible at the time of publication. Itâs a piece of largely overlooked evidence documenting Elonâs long business history in China and his relationship with the countryâs government, which has attracted  scrutiny from lawmakers  as he took over the  social media platform X  and began playing a central role in US politics. While many top American officials consider China a key foreign adversary, Musk has rarely criticized the country and relies on it as a major consumer market and manufacturing hub for Tesla. Elon did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED about when or why he deleted the tweet as well as another seemingly from the same trip in which he said he was âvery optimistic about Teslaâs long term future in China.â (Elon has deleted  hundreds of tweets  over the years spanning many topics, according to the PolitTweet archive.) Maye began building her own public image in China in late 2016 when she visited the country for the first time and spoke at an event hosted by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba. The company was promoting its global ecommerce fashion offerings and invited Maye, who it dubbed a âfashion legend,â to appear on stage with Alibabaâs then-chief marketing officer Chris Tung. That same year, a biography of Elon Musk written by Ashlee Vance was translated into Chinese, and people in China were eager to learn more about the tech entrepreneurâs mother. But her career really kicked off in 2020 when her own biography,  A Woman Makes a Plan , was also translated into Chinese. Around the same time, she registered accounts on the Chinese social media platforms Douyin and Weibo and held a virtual book talk  with Wendi Murdoch , the Chinese-born ex-wife of conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch. She also expressed interest in visiting China and Teslaâs factory in Shanghai, but noted the pandemic lockdowns were keeping her away. Maye later modeled for Chinese brands looking to showcase their global appeal, including the Chinese smartphone giant OPPO and several fashion and beauty companies. In 2023, she went on a whirlwind book tour across China which included some events sponsored by a Chinese womenâs underwear brand. By early 2024, Maye was so in demand that she was going âto China nearly every month,â she said at a fashion show in February where she  walked the runway  for a Chinese designer. Her trips, in turn,  were celebrated  by Chinaâs Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs as a way to encourage more foreigners to visit the country. While she usually emphasizes her career as a dietitian and book author, Mayeâs China trips have also served as publicity events for Tesla. On that same 2023 tour, Maye visited Teslaâs Gigafactory in Shanghai and was featured in  a video posted by Tesla , where she praised the âquality and the enthusiasmâ she saw at the facility. (Last month, Tesla expanded its presence in Shanghai by opening a  $200 million  battery manufacturing plant in the city.) But Mayeâs casual retweets and public support for Teslaâs global business turned into something much more dramatic this year. As her son was getting more involved in American politics and becoming Donald Trumpâs largest donor, Mayeâs social media presence in the West also experienced a 180-degree transformation. Her X timeline made almost no mention of either the word âDemocratâ or âRepublicanâ until September of last year, but now sheâs regularly endorsing Republican politicians and bashing the US media. In 2016, she tweeted about attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser with the hashtag #ImWithHer and a New Yorker story titled âThe Dangerous Acceptance of Donald Trumpâ but now appears in glitzy pictures taken at Trump rallies and Mar-a-Lago events. Her Chinese social media, which lists an email associated with Creative Artists Agency China as her business contact, doesn't show any of that. The focus remains brand advertisements, book promotions, and festive holiday videos in which she wishes happy Chinese New Year to her Chinese fans while wearing traditional Chinese clothes. She rarely brings up politics when sheâs traveling in China either. Maye flew to China several days after the US presidential election in November, where she was asked during a panel event what she thought of the results and her sonâs involvement. âHe is dedicated to making America a wonderful country and to give us hope. And now we have hope,â Maye said, before brushing off a question about whether Elon is expected to take a role in the government, saying only that he âreally likes rockets and cars.â For now, Maye appears to be maintaining her relationships in China. On January 16, she was invited by Chinaâs state-owned broadcaster to an event in New York City to celebrate the Chinese New Year during which the deputy head of Chinaâs top propaganda department gave a speech. Maye was also interviewed and wore a white dress with a Chinese festive design that she said was âmade specially for her.â Four days later, she would appear at Trumpâs inauguration party in Washington, DC, with her daughter in a long red dress with a crystal-embroidered brooch in the shape of a chrysanthemum. She would spend several nights partying with people like Trumpâs health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and artificial intelligence and crypto adviser David Sacks. Photos from these parties, just like those from the numerous American political events that she has been to since October, are nowhere to be found on her Chinese social media.",

    "date": "2025-03-27 17:47:31",
    "body": "A number of top Trump administration officialsâincluding four who were on a  now-infamous Signal group chat âappear to have  Venmo accounts  that have been leaking data, including contacts and in some cases transactions, to the public. Experts say this is a potentially serious counterintelligence problem that could allow foreign intelligence services to gain insight into a targetâs social network or even identify individuals who could be paid or coerced to act against them. The officials in question include Dan Katz, chief of staff at the US Treasury; Joe Kent, President Trumpâs nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to the secretary of state. All three were participants in the  âHouthi PC small groupâ chat  in which  sensitive attack plans  were discussed and to which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited. Katz was named in it as a point of contact by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary; Kent by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to whom Kent serves as acting chief of staff; and Needham by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. A fourth official with an open Venmo accountâBrian McCormack, a senior staffer on the National Security Councilâalso appears to have been in the chat, in which a user with the screen name âBrianâ lists McCormack as a point of contact for the NSC. His account went private after WIRED reached out to the NSC for comment. (âMr. McCormack has made necessary Venmo updates for his personal privacy protection,â says NSC spokesperson James Hewitt.) Morgan Ortagus, a former Fox News personality and deputy to Steve WitkoffâDonald Trumpâs special envoy for the Middle East, who was himself in the chatâalso appears to have left Venmo data exposed. WIRED established that the accounts are almost certainly those of the government officials in question by analyzing the other accounts they were connected to, which in the cases of Katz, Kent, and Needham included accounts appearing to belong to their spouses. The Treasury Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Some of the information revealed by the accounts is quite granular. McCormack and the accounts that appear to belong to Katz and Ortagus, for example, left not only their contact lists publicly visible but also their transactions, which are as recent as last autumn. These records reveal specific information like a 2018 payment from Katz with a note consisting solely of an eggplant emoji and how much he paid an overnight cat sitter in 2019. They also reveal McCormackâs contributions to what appears to be a get-together for veterans of the Bush-Cheney administration (âCheney team reunion! Thank you!!â), who has reimbursed Ortagus for picnic expenses, and Kentâs connection to noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself âthe secretary of retributionâ and once created a  deep state  target list. WIRED has previously reported on the partially public Venmo accounts of several of the high-ranking officials in the Houthi PC chat, including  Vice President JD Vance ;  Mike Waltz , the national security adviser; and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Waltz and Wiles set their accounts to private only after WIRED reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday afternoon. Venmo did not immediately respond to WIREDâs request for comment. In a statement given to WIRED in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, spokesperson Erin Mackey said, âWe take our customersâ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends listsâand we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.â Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dmehro.89 or timmarchman.01. âFrom my perspective, as a veteran, everyone is entitled to use the applications and services they feel are necessary to live their lives,â says Tara Lemieux, a 35-year veteran of the US intelligence community including the National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and supporting agencies. âThat said, when you post anything in those third-party applications and you donât understand how that information can be shared or exploited, you are taking a risk for our nationâand thatâs not acceptable.â For Lemieux, while public transactions on Venmo might appear harmless, foreign intelligence servicesâparticularly signals intelligence agenciesâlook for patterns: whoâs paying whom, how often, and when. âSay theyâre making payments to their childrenânow you have a point of leverage. If thereâs someone out there looking to target you, they can use that information and start making you feel fearful for the safety of your children,â Lemieux says. âThe speed of the digital world has outpaced our ability to keep a handle on it,â she adds. âIf you have all this information out thereâhow the heck are you going to put the toothpaste back in the tube?â Mike Yeagley, a specialist in commercial data and its security risks, has spent over 15 years advising the US Department of Defense on how both allies and adversaries leverage what he calls âdigital exhaust,â the seemingly mundane detailsâsocial connections, service transactions, and metadata trailsâleft behind in everyday apps. âAt the highest level of our national security leadership, regardless of administration, there has to be an awareness of our data and what we project that can be discoverable,â he says. âWhatâs the risk of someone at the Cabinet level using Venmo to pay their personal trainer? On the surface, it doesnât look like much,â Yeagley says. âBut now I know who that trainer isâor the gardener, or whoeverâand suddenly Iâve expanded my ability to target by identifying the people around that official.â Yeagley adds that âour adversaries are sophisticated and carnivorous in their data collection,â which means that âjust the smallest bit of daylight is of interest to someone sophisticated. They will use that data point. They will build from it.â According to Venmo, its âcontact syncingâ feature allows users to upload phone contacts to the app so that they can find people they know. When these exposed Venmo accounts were set upâall before 2020âthe app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Venmo says this functionality was deprecated more than two years ago. Today, contact syncing no longer creates connections by default. To add someone as a friend, users have to search for them, send a request, and have it accepted. Nevertheless, according to Venmoâs privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. That means that even when a user sets their account to private, their friends list remains visible unless they take an additional step. As of publication, hiding your connections requires navigating to  Settings  >  Privacy  >  Friends List  and selecting  Private . Stephen Lurie contributed reporting.",

The GSAâs effort to sell hundreds of US government properties is part of a blunt reshaping of the federal government and its workforce led by Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Staffed in part by  young engineers   with no prior   experience   in government , DOGEâs efforts have resulted in  mass reductions in force , the effective  shuttering of entirely independent agencies , and a  flurry of lawsuits  that seek to mitigate DOGEâs razing of the government over the past six weeks. The GSA published the list on Tuesday and pulled it down the next day. Before the full list of 443 properties was removed, more than 120 properties had already been quietly scrubbed, including 14 buildings that did not appear to be listed in the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties, a comprehensive public database of GSA holdings. Most of these properties, aside from one identified only as âBuilding A, 6810,â were labeled as either âButlerâ or âFranconia.â According to public records, all of them are part of a large federal facility known as the Parr-Franconia Warehouse Complex, or the GSA Warehouse, which sits, fenced in by chain-link topped with barbed wire, at 6810 Loisdale Road in Springfield. Most of the buildings in the complex, which dates back to the early 1950s and is dominated by a 1,005,602-square-foot warehouse long used as a government supply depot, are believed to be used by various government agencies for mundane purposes. Right in the middle of the complex, though, next to the warehouse and catty-corner to whatâs listed as Transportation Security Administration headquarters, is a U-shaped building long notorious for its alleged ties to the CIA. âObviously, someone did no research about the long and well-documented history of this property,â says Jeff McKay, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and a longtime advocate of redeveloping the complex, which is near a Metro station and sits in a prosperous area. âNormally a site like this wouldnât be outed, so to speak, but everyone knows itâs here except, apparently, the people who put this list together.â The CIAâs use of the building located at 6801 Springfield Center Drive, not all of which can necessarily be observed from street level, was  first reported  in 2012 by the Washington Business Journal, which in an article around the same time  called  the CIAâs presence in the area âperhaps the worst-kept secret in Springfield.â The most specific description of its purpose, as the publication noted, can be found in the 2011 spy-agency-focused nonfiction book  Fallout: The True Story of the CIAâs Secret War on Nuclear Trafficking , by Catherine Collins and Douglas Frantz, who  write , while describing a clandestine operation: âThere were two pick-and-lock specialists from the agencyâs secret facility in Springfield, Virginia. In a warehouse-like building there, the CIA trains a cadre of technical officers to bug offices, break into houses, and penetrate computer systems.â (Whether it is currently used for these purposes is unknown.) According to the Journalâs reporting, Fairfax County leaders like McKay were frustrated, because plans to redevelop the complex ran up against the existence of this facility. âThe entire challenge with redevelopment has been this entity,â McKay tells WIRED. âThis idea that you can sell everything around it and it will be OK runs counter to all the intelligence information weâve been given over the past couple of decades. Without divulging the specific details of the activities, the government has been very clear about the sensitivity of the property.â Even a widely supported plan to  relocate FBI headquarters  to Springfield foundered due in part to the CIA presence. While the FBI would not have raised security concerns, its relocation to the site would have raised logistical ones. Some government agencies, says McKay, said redevelopment was impossible; others said the secret facility would have to be relocated at the expense of the incoming tenant, making it far more expensive than other potential sites.

Since Tuesday, GSA sources have been wondering about the possible inclusion of CIA buildings on the list that was posted and then deleted. One source with knowledge of CIA operations, when asked about concerns that the GSA may have listed at least one of the agencyâs facilities as being for sale, immediately acknowledged âthe Springfield building.â (The building itself, which in past reporting has been described as being held by a private owner, does not appear to have been listed for sale, but due to its sensitivity, selling the buildings around it would raise much the same concerns.) âThere have been rumors swirling that some of the buildings identified house classified CIA space,â says one source at GSA, adding, âthe release of ânon-core propertiesâ was especially surprising, as this nebulous language has not been historically usedâ at the GSA. As the Washington Business Journal reported in 2012, a real estate appraisal in the late 1990s listed the CIA as one of the complexâs tenants, indicating its presence there extends back at least three decades. It is nonetheless possible that the GSA does not know, at least officially, that the CIA has operated within the Springfield warehouse complex, a source at the GSA tells WIRED. âIn general, we have agencies that perform many critical law enforcement and national security functions,â they say. âWe are not always aware of what type of operations are being conducted within tenant spaces. We build out operations to their specs and ensure their spaces are up to code. In my own personal experience, there are spaces in our buildings that not everyone knows about. Not necessarily CIA specifically.â âI think it just shows you how completely unorganized this bird-shot of a list is,â says McKay. The CIA declined to comment. The GSA did not respond to WIREDâs request for comment. On Wednesday, the GSA issued a statement acknowledging the feedback the agency had received and asserting that inclusion on the originally published list did not mean a building would be up for sale immediately. âWe anticipate the list will be republished in the near future after we evaluate this initial input,â the statement read, âand determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.â âI am not saying itâs CIA or not,â a former intelligence analyst who worked at Langley for more than a decade tells WIRED. âBut itâs reckless that this information is out there at all. It speaks to the fact that these guys have no interest in even understanding government operations.â Matt Giles contributed reporting.",

    "body": "The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administrationâs (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the systemâand the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans relyâat risk. The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months. Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than  65 million people  in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits. âOf course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [itâs also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,â an SSA technologist tells WIRED. The Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIREDâs request for comment. SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trumpâs administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk  pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system  that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isnât actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone,  The Washington Post reported this week . This proposed migration isnât the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The  agency predicted  that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects. Like many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administrationâs DEI purge of military acknowledgements.) As recently as 2016, SSAâs infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages,  the agencyâs Office of the Inspector General found . In fact, SSAâs core programmatic systems and architecture havenât been âsubstantiallyâ updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler,  according to SSAâs 2017 modernization plan . SSAâs core âlogicâ is also written largely in COBOL. This is the code that issues social security numbers, manages payments, and even calculates the total amount beneficiaries should receive for different services, a former senior SSA technologist who worked in the office of the chief information officer says. Even minor changes could result in cascading failures across programs. âIf you weren't worried about a whole bunch of people not getting benefits or getting the wrong benefits, or getting the wrong entitlements, or having to wait ages, then sure go ahead,â says Dan Hon, principal of Very Little Gravitas, a technology strategy consultancy that helps government modernize services, about completing such a migration in a short timeframe. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32. Itâs unclear when exactly the code migration would start. A recent document circulated amongst SSA staff laying out the agencyâs priorities through May does not mention it, instead naming other priorities like terminating ânon-essential contractsâ and adopting artificial intelligence to âaugmentâ administrative and technical writing. Earlier this month,  WIRED reported that at least 10 DOGE operatives  were currently working within SSA, including a number of young and inexperienced engineers like Luke Farritor and Ethan Shaotran. At the time, sources told WIRED that the DOGE operatives would focus on how people identify themselves to access their benefits online. Sources within SSA expect the project to begin in earnest once DOGE identifies and marks remaining beneficiaries as deceased and connecting disparate agency databases. In a Thursday morning court filing, an  affidavit  from SSA acting administrator Leland Dudek said that at least two DOGE operatives are currently working on a project formally called the âAre You Alive Project,â targeting what these operatives believe to be improper payments and fraud within the agencyâs system by calling individual beneficiaries. The agency is currently battling for sweeping access to SSAâs systems in court to finish this work. (Again,  150-year-olds  are not collecting social security benefits. That specific age was likely a quirk of COBOL. It doesnât include a date type, so dates are often coded to a specific reference pointâMay 20, 1875, the date of an international standards-setting conference held in Paris, known as the Convention du MÃ¨tre.) In order to migrate all COBOL code into a more modern language within a few months, DOGE would likely need to employ some form of generative artificial intelligence to help translate the millions of lines of code, sources tell WIRED. âDOGE thinks if they can say they got rid of all the COBOL in months, then their way is the right way, and we all just suck for not breaking shit,â says the SSA technologist. DOGE would also need to develop tests to ensure the new systemâs outputs match the previous one. It would be difficult to resolve all of the possible edge cases over the course of several years, let alone months, adds the SSA technologist. âThis is an environment that is held together with bail wire and duct tape,â the former senior SSA technologist working in the office of the chief information officer tells WIRED. âThe leaders need to understand that theyâre dealing with a house of cards or Jenga. If they start pulling pieces out, which theyâve already stated theyâre doing, things can break.â",

    "body": "Thousands of federal employees at the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  were notified early Tuesday morning that they were subject to a  reduction in force , or RIF, sources tell WIRED, shuttering programs that directly serve and inform the American public. The effect was felt across the CDC, as workers in the  Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice  (DEHSP), the Division of Population Health, the Division of HIV Prevention, the Division of Reproductive Health, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control all received RIF notices today. Dozens of other programs throughout the CDCâs national centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; Environmental Health; Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and the Global Health center were also impacted. Multiple sources in the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that houses the CDC, say that RIF notices began going out around 5 am ET on Tuesday. Employees across HHS offices arrived at buildings only to discover that their badges no longer worked, sources tell WIRED. âI regret to inform you that you are being affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,â reads the email to affected employees. âThis RIF does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct. It is being taken solely for the reasons stated in the memorandum. After you receive this notice you will be placed on administrative leave and will no longer have building access beginning Tuesday, April 1, unless directed otherwise by your leadership.â The memorandum refers to the  February 11 executive order  from President Donald Trump titled âImplementing the President's âDepartment of Government Efficiencyâ Workforce Optimization Initiative.â âThe cuts today at CDC targeted programs that address all aspects of American lives,â a source at the CDC tells WIRED. âThis will lead to worse health outcomes, greater risks to the US public, and will contribute to the decline in US life expectancy â¦ programs that were eliminated fund positions across the country, in red and blue districts.â âThere has been no effort in allowing staff to transfer projects, programs, or responsibilities,â says one CDC staffer. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, makenakelly.32, and Kateknibbs.09. These cuts will have immediate impact, experts say. At the Division for HIV Prevention, where the stated mission is âto promote health and quality of life by preventing HIV infection and reducing HIV-related illness and death in the United States,â at least half of the employees received RIF notices. âWeâre going to have patients die,â says Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Chicago who also specializes in HIV prevention. âUnnecessary, preventable death.â Joseph Cherabie, a physician and assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, says that these cuts will have devastating consequences for HIV patients around the country, especially in rural areas: âIt will be catastrophic.â Cherabie says that states relying heavily on federal funding for public health initiatives, like Missouri, where he works, will be hit especially hard. âWe're still seeing young people coming in with new HIV diagnoses, sometimes advanced HIV,â says Cherabie. Along with six other states, Missouri has been  awarded  CDC funding dedicated to lowering HIV infections, which helps pay for medicine like pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) for at-risk patients. Cherabie says patients outside of cities heavily rely on these kinds of CDC-funded HIV programs. âOur efforts are largely dependent on these federal grants,â he says. âWe use them to make sure that we are able to distribute HIV testing equipment. We use them to make sure that we can get information and data on how much PrEP is being distributed, how many HIV diagnoses we have, how many HIV tests we're giving out. If we lose that, then we're moving around in the dark.â An email from the CDCâs DEHSP center director states that the division is âslated to be eliminated in its entirety.â The division includes the Asthma and Air Quality Branch, the Climate and Health Activity, the Emerging Environmental Hazards and Health Effects Branch, the Environmental Public Health Tracking Branch, the Lead Poisoning Prevention and Surveillance Branch, and the Water, Food, and Environmental Health Services Branch. All of these branches provide key services, and hundreds of employees received RIFs. Other divisions within DEHSP include, for example, the CDCâs Vessel Sanitation Program, which helps the cruise industry prevent public health issues, inspects cruises, and provides information on outbreaks. Itâs unclear if the programâs work involving cruise inspections, or the  lists of outbreaks  on cruises, will continue. Similarly, the Lead Poisoning branch that works to eliminate childhood lead poisoning has also been gutted by RIFs. Itâs unclear how much of its work will be able to continue. The CDC cuts are part of the Trump administrationâs plans to remove more than 10,000 Health and Human Services employees. Those sweeping reductions were âorchestratedâ by Brad Smith, a member of Elon Muskâs so-called Department of Government Efficiency,  according to Politico . The agency-wide cuts were originally expected to fall on Friday.  In a press release last Thursday , HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that this restructuring, paired with early retirements and deferred resignations, would reduce the agency workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. âOver time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,â Kennedy said in a statement  announcing the restructuring last week . âThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. Thatâs the entire American public, because our goal is to Make America Healthy Again.â Anu Hazra, another infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago who also works as a physician at the nonprofit medical clinic Howard Brown Health, says that cuts to CDC funding will severely curb the type of HIV prevention and testing he does, and potentially outright eliminate some of the services offered. âItâs the only way that the work gets done,â he says; he does not believe that other institutions will be able to compensate for the loss of federal funding. âThe idea that you can just privatize public health, I donât think itâs a realistic solution.â Hazra says that funding cuts will disproportionately impact people like his patients on the South Side of Chicago, who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged Black communities that âeither donât have access or have really reduced accessâ to medical services including HIV prevention and treatment. Several doctors WIRED spoke to were unnerved because President Donald Trumpâs first administration had championed federal HIV prevention funding initiatives, which aimed to essentially end new HIV infections in the US by 2030, so they did not anticipate this radical change. âThis work that weâre doing was thanks to him,â Hazra says. âThis is not just something that impacts people in the ivory tower. This is not just something that impacts people who are physicians, or scientists, or academics,â says Pagkas-Bather. âThis is coming for you.â Additional reporting by Emily Mullin.",

    "intro": "No intro",
    "date": "2025-03-31 16:38:24",
    "body": "In 1974, the United States Congress passed  the Privacy Act  in response to public concerns over the US governmentâs runaway efforts to harness Americansâ personal data. Now Democrats in the US Senate are calling to amend the half-century-old law, citing ongoing attempts by billionaire Elon Muskâs so-called  Department of Government Efficiency  (DOGE) to effectively commit the same offenseâcollusively collect untold quantities of personal data, drawing upon dozens if not hundreds of government systems. On Monday, Democratic senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen introduced the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025âa direct response, the lawmakers say, to the  seizure by DOGE  of computer systems containing vast tranches of sensitive personal informationâmoves that have notably coincided with the firings of hundreds of government officials charged with overseeing that dataâs protection. âThe seizure of millions of Americansâ sensitive information by Trump, Musk and other MAGA goons is plainly illegal,â Wyden tells WIRED, âbut current remedies are too slow and need more teeth.â The passage of the Privacy Act came in the wake of the McCarthy eraâone of the darkest periods in American history, marked by unceasing ideological warfare and a government run amok, obsessed with constructing vast record systems to house files on hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations. Secret dossiers on private citizens were the primary tool for suppressing free speech, assembly, and opinion, fueling decadesâ worth of sedition prosecutions, loyalty oaths, and deportation proceedings. Countless writers, artists, teachers, and attorneys saw their livelihoods destroyed, while civil servants were routinely rounded up and purged as part of the roving inquisitions. The first privacy law aimed at truly reining in the power of the administrative state, the Privacy Act was passed during the dawn of the microprocessor revolution, amid an emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks and âautomated personal data systems.â The explosion in advancements coincided with  Cassandra-like fears  among ordinary Americans about a rise in unchecked government surveillance through the use of âuniversal identifiers.â A wave of such controversies, including Watergate and COINTELPRO, had all but annihilated public trust in the governmentâs handling of personal data. âThe Privacy Act was part of our countryâs response to the FBI abusing its access to revealing sensitive records on the American people,â says Wyden. âOur bill defends against new threats to Americansâ privacy and the integrity of federal systems, and ensures individuals can go after the government when officials break the law, including quickly stopping their illegal actions with a court order.â The bill, first obtained by WIRED last week, would implement several textual changes aimed at strengthening the lawâredefining, for instance, common terms such as ârecordâ and âprocessâ to more aptly comport with their usage in the 21st century. It further takes aim at certain exemptions and provisions under the Privacy Act that have faced decadesâ worth of criticism by leading privacy and civil liberties experts. While the Privacy Act generally forbids the disclosure of Americansâ private records except to the âindividual to whom the records pertain,â there are currently at least 10 exceptions that apply to this rule. Private records may be disclosed, for example, without consent in the interest of national defense, to determine an individualâs suitability for federal employment, or to âprevent, control, or reduce crime.â But one exception has remained controversial from the very start. Known as âroutine use,â it enables government agencies to disclose private records so long as the reason for doing so is âcompatibleâ with the purpose behind their collection. The arbitrary ways in which the government applies the âroutine useâ exemption have been drawing criticism since at least 1977, when a  blue-ribbon commission  established by Congress reported that federal law enforcement agencies were creating âbroad-worded routine uses,â while other agencies were engaged in âquid pro quoâ arrangementsâcrafting their own novel âroutine uses,â as long as other agencies joined in doing the same. Nearly a decade later, Congressâ own group of assessors would find that âroutine useâ had become a â catch-all exemption â to the law. In an effort to stem the overuse of this exemption, the bill introduced by the Democratic senators includes a new stipulation that, combined with enhanced minimization requirements, would require any âroutine useâ of private data to be both âappropriateâ and âreasonably necessary,â providing a hook for potential plaintiffs in lawsuits against government offenders down the road. Meanwhile, agencies would be required to make publicly known âany purposeâ for which a Privacy Act record might actually be employed. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030. Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the bill would also hand Americans the right to sue states and municipalities, while expanding the right of action to include violations that could reasonably lead to harms. âWatching the courts and how theyâve handled the whole variety of suits filed under the Privacy Act, it's been frustrating to see them not take the data harms seriously or recognize the potential eventual harms that could come to be,â he says. Another major change, he adds, is that the bill expands who's actually covered under the Privacy Act from merely citizens and legal residents to virtually anyone physically inside the United Statesâaligning the law more firmly with current federal statutes limiting the reach of the government's most powerful surveillance tools. In another key provision, the bill further seeks to rein in the governmentâs use of so-called â computer matching ,â a process whereby a personâs private records are cross-referenced across two agencies, helping the government draw new inferences it couldnât by examining each record alone. This was a loophole that Congress previously acknowledged in 1988, the first time it amended the Privacy Act, requiring agencies to enter into written agreements before engaging in matching, and to calculate how matching might impact an individualâs rights. The changes imposed under the Democratsâ new bill would merely extend these protections to different record systems held by a single agency. To wit, the Internal Revenue Service has one system that contains records on âerroneous tax refunds,â while another holds data on the âseizure and sale of real property.â These changes would ensure that the restrictions on matching still apply, even though both systems are controlled by the IRS. Whatâs more, while the restrictions on matching do not currently extend to âstatistical projects,â they would under the new text, if the projectâs purpose might impact the individualsâ ârights, benefits, or privileges.â Orâin the case of federal employeesâresult in any âfinancial, personnel, or disciplinary action.â The Privacy Act currently imposes rather meager criminal fines (no more than $5,000) against government employees who knowingly disclose Americansâ private records to anyone ineligible to receive them. The Democratsâ bill introduces a fine of up to $250,000, as well as the possibility of imprisonment, for anyone who leaks records âfor commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.â The bill has been endorsed by the  Electronic Privacy Information Center  and  Public Citizen , two civil liberties nonprofits that are both engaged in active litigation against DOGE. âOver 50 years ago, Congress passed the Privacy Act to protect the public against the exploitation and misuse of their personal information held by the government,â Markey says in a statement. âToday, with Elon Musk and the DOGE team recklessly seeking to access Americansâ sensitive data, itâs time to bring this law into the digital age.â",
